## What is Policy as code?

Policy-as-code, similar to Infrastructure-as-code, is the concept of using declarative code to replace actions that require using a user interface. By representing policies in code, proven software development best practices can be adopted, such as version control, collaboration, and automation.

## How does it work?

Once the Policy-as-code (PaC) mode is enabled, the only way to change the policies in your account is by publishing a YAML configuration file ([policies.yaml](/dashboard/policy-as-code#policiesyaml)) with the defined policies.

### 1. Enable Policy-as-code (PaC) mode

On the [Settings page](https://app.datree.io/settings), toggle on the Policy-as-code switch.

### 2. Apply a new policies configuration

To change the policies in your account you will need to update the policies configuration YAML file ([policies.yaml](/dashboard/policy-as-code#policiesyaml)) and publish it:

```terminal
datree publish policies.yaml
```

:::tip
Once a new policy configuration file is published, it will override the existing policies set up in your account.
:::

## policies.yaml

You can export your policies configurations via the dashboard or write a new policies configuration YAML file from scratch:

- **name** - the name of your policy (e.g. "staging")

- **isDefault **- policy to evaluate when `-policy` flag is not used

- **identifier **- unique rule ID (can be also found in the rule docs)

- **messageOnFailure **- message to show when the rule is failing

### [Example] single policy configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
policies:
  - name: Default
    isDefault: true
    rules:
      - identifier: CONTAINERS_MISSING_IMAGE_VALUE_VERSION
        messageOnFailure: Incorrect value for key `image` - specify an image version to avoid unpleasant "version surprises" in the future
      - identifier: DEPLOYMENT_MISSING_LABEL_ENV_VALUE
        messageOnFailure: 'Missing label object `env` - add a proper environment description (e.g. "prod", "testing", etc.) to the Deployment config'
```

### \[Example] multiple policies configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
policies:
  - name: Default
    isDefault: true
    rules:
      - identifier: CONTAINERS_MISSING_IMAGE_VALUE_VERSION
        messageOnFailure: Incorrect value for key `image` - specify an image version to avoid unpleasant "version surprises" in the future
      - identifier: DEPLOYMENT_MISSING_LABEL_ENV_VALUE
        messageOnFailure: 'Missing label object `env` - add a proper environment description (e.g. "prod", "testing", etc.) to the Deployment config'
  - name: Mandatory_resources
    rules:
      - identifier: CONTAINERS_MISSING_CPU_LIMIT_KEY
        messageOnFailure: Missing property object `limits.cpu` - value should be within the accepted boundaries recommended by the organization
      - identifier: CONTAINERS_MISSING_MEMORY_LIMIT_KEY
        messageOnFailure: Missing property object `limits.memory` - value should be within the accepted boundaries recommended by the organization
```

:::info

### Disabling a rule from a policy

Delete the rule or comment out (#) from the rules list property
:::

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
policies:
  - name: Default
    isDefault: true
    rules:
    #   - identifier: INGRESS_INCORRECT_HOST_VALUE_PERMISSIVE
    #     messageOnFailure: Incorrect value for key `host` - specify host instead of using a wildcard character ("*")
```

### Default policies YAML file

The default policies file looks like this: [policies.yaml](https://github.com/datreeio/datree/blob/main/examples/defaultPaC/policies.yaml)

## Best practice

To make your delivery as simple and smooth as possible, keep your policy-as-code yaml file in its own repository, and as part of your CI/CD workflow run `datree publish policies.yaml`. This will ensure your policy file is valid and updated. Github workflow example:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

env:
  DATREE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DATREE_TOKEN }}

jobs:
  publish-policy-as-code:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install Datree
        run: curl https://get.datree.io | /bin/bash

      - name: Publish Policies
        run: datree publish policies.yaml
```
