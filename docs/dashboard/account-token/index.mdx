## What is a token

The token connects your policy checks to your [Centralized policy](/dashboard/centralized-policy), which determines your available policies.  
Additionally, the token allows Datree to report your policy check history to the dashboard.  

**Each token has the following properties:**

- **Label:** the name of the token, as presented in the history tab in your dashboard.
- **Type:** can be one of the following:
    * *read* - allows using the policies in the dashboard, but forbids editing/creating them.
    * *write* - allows using/editing/creating policies and tokens.

:::info
Tokens are immutable. To change one of the token's properties, a new token needs to be created and set in the CLI.

## Connect your dashboard to your cluster

### 1. Get your account token from the dashboard

- Log into your account

- Go to "SETTINGS" (click on the avatar in the upper-right corner)  
![settings](/img/dashboard/account-token/1.png)

- Copy your account token  
![get_token](/img/dashboard/account-token/2.png)

### 2. Set your token in your cluster

To set your token, simply copy it and run the command specified [here](/configuration/behavior#setchange-token).

#### Setting your token in the CLI

To set your token when using the **CLI**, run the following command in your terminal (replace `<token>` with your token):

```terminal
datree config set token <token>
```

This will replace the token inside the config file (`~/.datree/config.yaml`)

## Token Management

### Creating new tokens
A single account can have multiple tokens. Creating new tokens is done via the Token Management tab in your dashboard settings.
:::info
Policy checks executed with a certain token are reported only to the dashboard of that token's creator.

## Using tokens in your CI
Setting your token in your CI is done using the `DATREE_TOKEN` environment variable. The Datree CLI automatically checks this variable and uses its value as the token.  
See our [CI/CD section](/cicd-examples) for examples using popular platforms.
