The [overview page](https://app.datree.io/overview) contains information about your clusters and their health.

### Cluster score

Each cluster that has Datree installed in it has a score (A - E), based on the amount of misconfigurations found in Datree's scans. This provides a picture of the validity and stability of your resources.

### Background scan

Datree runs a scan every hour, checking your cluster for misconfigurations and displaying the results on this page.

The sync status of your cluster is updated in real time and displayed on this page.  
For example, if a change is made in your cluster before a new scan was performed:

![scan_out_of_date](/img/dashboard/overview/scan-out-of-date.png)

To initiate a scan manually, run the following command:

```terminal
kubectl delete jobs/scan-job -n datree; kubectl create job --from=cronjob/scan-cronjob scan-job -n datree
```

### Failing configurations per namespace

The pie chart can be used to determine your most problematic namespaces. Clicking on a namespace will take you to the [drilldown](/dashboard/drilldown) page, containing more information about the resources for which the rule failed.

### Rules

On the bottom of the page, you can see 2 lists of rules - one for the rules that failed in the last scan, and the other for rules that passed.  
Clicking on a failed rule will take you to the [drilldown](/dashboard/drilldown) page, where you can see more information about the rule and its violations in your cluster.
