"Centralized policy" is the concept of controlling distributed policy execution from a centralized location. This enables the policy owner to easily control the rules that are evaluated in each run of Datree without creating operation overhead. Logging into the [dashboard](https://app.datree.io) allows you to manage the centralized policy.

## Enable and disable rules in a policy

Each of the [built-in](/built-in-rules) rules can be toggled "ON" or "OFF" in the [dashboard](https://app.datree.io) to suit your needs. Once a rule is disabled or enabled, it will automatically propagate to all policy checks executed against that policy (via [account token](/dashboard/account-token)). This way, the policy owner is not required to manually update all of the devices connected to this policy.

## Edit rule fail suggestion text

The output text that is shown in the CLI when a rule fails is editable. The policy owner can use this to educate policy consumers (e.g. developers, teammates, etc.) and clarify how they should fix their misconfigurations.

## Policy management

Add policies with different rules configured, giving each of your use cases its own custom policy.

### Add a new policy

Create a new policy and give it a descriptive name.

By default, each new policy is created without any rules enabled, giving you the freedom to configure it according to your needs.

### Running checks against the new policy

To run the Datree CLI against the new policy (instead of the default one), you will need to add the \`_-p \[policy-name]_\` to your policy check execution (e.g. `$ datree test ~/.datree/k8s-demo.yaml -p A_team`)

```terminal
$ datree test [K8s-manifest] -p [policy-name]
```
