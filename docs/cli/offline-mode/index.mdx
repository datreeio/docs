## Air-gapped environment support
It is possible to run Datree as a standalone in an air-gapped environment by preforming the following steps:
1. Download [Datree’s binary](https://github.com/datreeio/datree/releases/latest) 
2. Manually copy the binary to your offline environment 
3. Set `offline=local` in your local [config file](/cli/cli-arguments/#configure-the-cli):  
```terminal
datree config set offline local
```

When setting Datree to work without an internet connection, you will lose the following functionality:
* Centralized policy registry
* Automatic Kubernetes schema validation
* Access to the dashboard and all of its components (e.g. history page, token management, etc.)

:::info
If your environment **has internet access** and your concern is sending policy checks metadata to your dashboard, you can use the `--no-record` flag instead of the offline mode. If you still choose to use the offline mode, you will first need to [enable the policy-as-code mode](https://hub.datree.io/dashboard/policy-as-code#1-enable-policy-as-code-pac-mode).

### How to customize your policy check locally
By design, Datree’s binary is compiled together with the [built-in policies](https://hub.datree.io/built-in-rules#containers) and their pre-configured (enabled) rules.  
When running `datree test`, you will test your manifests against the "Default" policy.

To overwrite the "Default" policy setup, you will need to pass Datree your own [policy-as-code](https://hub.datree.io/dashboard/policy-as-code#policiesyaml) (YAML) configuration file path with the `--policy-config` flag:
```terminal
datree test [manifest] --policy-config [policyAsCodeFile]
```
```terminal
E.g: datree test k8s-demo.yaml --policy-config policies.yaml
```

### How to enable Kubernetes schema validation locally
When there is an internet connection, Datree knows how to fetch the relevant Kubernetes schema from [GitHub](https://github.com/yannh/kubernetes-json-schema). 

Therefore, to enable this check in the offline mode, you will need to preform the following steps:
1. [Copy](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home) the relevant schema version dir (e.g. [v1.21.0-standalone-strict/](https://github.com/yannh/kubernetes-json-schema/tree/2e2c25d6ca2e59ebffaebb23a59eb4130b5ad2a4/v1.21.0-standalone-strict)) to your air-gapped environment
2. Pass the dir location to Datree CLI with the `--schema-location` flag:
```terminal
datree test [manifest] --schema-location '[schemaVersionDir]/{{.ResourceKind}}{{.KindSuffix}}.json'
```
```terminal
E.g: datree test k8s-demo.yaml --schema-location 'v1.21.0-standalone-strict/{{.ResourceKind}}{{.KindSuffix}}.json'
```

:::info
Note that `{{.ResourceKind}}{{.KindSuffix}}.json` does not need to be replaced with an actual filename, the CLI will be able to access all .json files with this name format in the specified directory.
```terminal
datree test [manifest] --schema-location '[schemaVersionDir]/{{.ResourceKind}}{{.KindSuffix}}.json'
```
