Once Datree is installed, every [hooked operation](/configuration/overview) will trigger a policy check.  

By default, enforce mode is **disabled**, meaning that if any misconfigurations were found, Datree will warn you about them but will not fail the operation:

When enforce mode is **enabled**, Datree will provide a detailed output of the detected misconfigurations, deny the operation and the resource will not be applied/updated:
