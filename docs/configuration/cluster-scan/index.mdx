title: Cluster scan
slug: /configuration/cluster-scan
---

By default, Datree will scan your cluster(s) every hour, and update your dashboard accordingly.  

## Scan interval

You can set the scan interval to be longer than 1 hour (but not shorter). To do this, run the following command:
```terminal
helm upgrade -n datree datree-webhook datree-webhook/datree-admission-webhook --reuse-values --set datree.scanIntervalHours=<interval>
```

Replace `<interval>` with the number of hours you'd like to have between scans.

## Policy

The [policy](/built-in-rules)(set of rules) used for the scan is the same one that is used when deploying new resources into the cluster. This policy is displayed in your [dashboard](https://app.datree.io), and can be changed using the command shown [here](/configuration/behavior#options).

## Supported resources

The scan will check the following resource kinds:

| **Type** | **Kind** |
|---|---|
| Native k8s | `deployment`, `pod`, `daemonset`, `statefulset`,	`replicaset`, `cronjob`, `job`, `ingress`, `service`, `replicationcontroller`, `horizontalpodautoscaler`, `configmap`, `endpointslice`, `serviceaccount`, `role`, `clusterrole`, `rolebindings`, `clusterrolebinding` |
| Argo CRDs | `workflow`, `workflowtemplate`, `rollout`, `application`, `appproject` |

### Excluded resources

The scan will ignore resources with the following `labels`:
* `kubernetes.io/bootstrapping: rbac-defaults` - used by Kubernetes to label default RBAC resources
* `app.kubernetes.io/part-of: datree` - used by Datree to label its own resources

## Manual scan

To initiate a scan manually, run the following command:

```terminal
kubectl delete jobs/scan-job -n datree; kubectl create job --from=cronjob/scan-cronjob scan-job -n datree
```
