title: Cluster scan
slug: /configuration/cluster-scan
---

By default, Datree will scan your cluster(s) every hour, and update your dashboard accordingly.  

## Policy

The [policy](/built-in-rules)(set of rules) used for the scan is the same one that is used when deploying new resources into the cluster. This policy is displayed in your [dashboard](https://app.datree.io), and can be changed using the command shown [here](/configuration/behavior#options).

## Supported resources

The scan will check the following resource kinds:

| **Type** | **Kind** |
|---|---|
| Native k8s | `deployment`, `pod`, `daemonset`,	`statefulset`,	`replicaset`, `cronjob`, `job`, `ingress`, `service`, `replicationcontroller`, `horizontalpodautoscaler`, `configmap`, `endpointslice`, `role`, `serviceaccount` |
| Argo CRDs | `workflow`, `workflowtemplate`, `rollout`, `application`, `appproject` |

## Manual scan

To initiate a scan manually, run the following command:

```terminal
kubectl delete jobs/scan-job -n datree; kubectl create job --from=cronjob/scan-cronjob scan-job -n datree
```
