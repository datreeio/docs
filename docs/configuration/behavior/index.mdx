## Set/change token


Since your token is sensitive ðŸ¤« and you would not want to keep it in your repository, we recommend to set/change it by running a separate `kubectl patch` command:

```yaml
kubectl patch deployment webhook-server -n datree -p '
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: server
          env:
            - name: DATREE_TOKEN
              value: "<your-token>"'
```
Simply replace `<your-token>` with your actual [token](https://app.datree.io/settings/token-management), then copy the entire command and run it in your terminal.

## Options

The following options are available for configuring Datree's behavior:

| **Option** | **Description** | **Type** |
|---|---|---|
| `policy` | The name of the policy to check, e.g: "Argo" | string |
| `verbose` | Display 'How to Fix' link for failed rules in output | boolean |
| `output` | The format output of the policy check results: yaml, json, xml, simple, JUnit, sarif | string |
| `noRecord` | Donâ€™t send policy checks metadata to the dashboard | boolean |
| `enforce` | Block resources that fail the policy check from being applied to the cluster | boolean |  


### Configure options
To set/change one or more options, choose one of the following methods:

#### 1. Using a Helm inline command

The following example will enable enforce mode and block resources that fail the policy check:
```terminal
helm upgrade -n datree datree-webhook datree-webhook/datree-admission-webhook --reuse-values --set datree.enforce="true"
```

#### 2. Using a new Helm values file

Create a YAML file with your desired values, then run the following command to apply it:
```terminal
helm upgrade -n datree -f newValues.yaml datree-webhook datree-webhook/datree-admission-webhook
```

---

## Ignore a namespace
Add the label `"admission.datree/validate=skip"` to the configuration of the namespace you would like to ignore:

```terminal
kubectl label namespaces default "admission.datree/validate=skip"
```

To delete the label and resume running the datree webhook on the namespace again:

```terminal
kubectl label namespaces default "admission.datree/validate-"
```

---

## Skip specific rules for a single object

To skip a rule for a specific object, add the following annotation to its manifest:  
```yaml
datree.skip/[identifier]: [message]
```

**identifier** - the unique rule identifier.  
**message** - optional text to be presented in the policy check output (CLI and history tab at the dashboard).  <br/><br/>

To obtain identifiers of *built-in rules*, go to your [dashboard](https://app.datree.io/cli/policies/) and click on the 'i' icon of your desired rule:  

![rule_i](/img/configuration/behavior/1.png)

This will lead you to the documentation of the rule, where you will find the identifier:  

![rule_identifier_docs](/img/configuration/behavior/2.png)

Identifiers of [*custom rules*](/custom-rules/custom-rules-overview) can be found in the policy.yaml file, when in Policy-as-code mode.  For example:  
```yaml
customRules:
  - identifier: CUSTOM_WORKLOAD_INCORRECT_ENVIRONMENT_LABELS
    name: Ensure correct environment labels are used [CUSTOM RULE]
    defaultMessageOnFailure: Use only approved environment labels ('prod', 'staging' and 'test')
    schema:
```

#### Example of a Deployment with skipped rules:  
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: rss-site
  namespace: test
  labels:
    environment: prod
    app: web
  annotations:
    datree.skip/WORKLOAD_INVALID_LABELS_VALUE: irrelevant for deployments, skipping.
    datree.skip/CONTAINERS_MISSING_LIVENESSPROBE_KEY: irrelevant for prod environment, skipping.
```

:::info Note
`annotations` have a character limit - the key and value of an annotation cannot exceed 63 characters each.  
For more information, see the [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/#syntax-and-character-set)

## Custom skipping

Datree can be configured to skip certain rules by using a dedicated `ConfigMap` (see example below).  
* The `ConfigMap` must be named 'webhook-scanning-filters.yaml' and must reside in the 'datree' namespace.
* Enter the resources you wish to skip under the `data.skiplist` key, in the format of *namespace;resourceKind;resourceName*.
* You can use a regular expression for any of the aformentioned properties.

:::info Important
After creating/changing your `ConfigMap`, run `kubectl rollout restart deployment -n datree` to restart the webhook and apply your changes.
:::

The following example will cause the webhook to skip all resources of type (kind) `ServiceAccount` in all namespaces, regardless of their name:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: webhook-scanning-filters
  namespace: datree
data:
  skiplist: |
    - (.*);ServiceAccount;(.*)
```

The following example will skip all resources in the namespace 'myNs':
```yaml
data:
  skiplist: |
    - myNs;(.*);(.*)
```

The following example will skip all resources in all namespaces if the resource name starts with the prefix 'appName-':
```yaml
data:
  skiplist: |
    - (.*);(.*);(^appName-.*)
```

## Uninstall

To uninstall Datree, run the following command in your terminal:

```terminal
helm uninstall datree-webhook -n datree
kubectl delete ns datree
```
