## Dashboard vs. Helm chart configuration

By default, the following options are configurable via your [dashboard](https://app.datree.io/clusters):
- **Action on failure** - Select whether to monitor or block resources that fail the policy check (defaults to "monitor").
- **Active policy** - The name of the policy to check (defaults to "Starter").
- **Bypass permissions** - Users/groups/ServiceAccounts that are able to bypass a failing policy check.
- **Ignored resources** - Resources to be ignored, in regex format, specified by namespace/kind/name or any combination of the three. See examples [here](/configuration/behavior#example-patterns).

If you wish to control these options via the Datree Helm chart instead, you can do so by changing the value of the `configFromHelm` parameter:
```yaml
# values.yaml
datree:
  configFromHelm: true
```
Then apply your updated `values.yaml` file:
```terminal
helm upgrade -n datree -f values.yaml datree-webhook datree-webhook/datree-admission-webhook
```
Now you can control the parameters described in the table below via your Helm chart.  
To update your dashboard and reflect the changes, run a [manual scan](/configuration/cluster-scan#manual-scan).


:::caution Important
* When controlling these options via the dashboard, changing them via the Helm chart will have no effect.  
* All other configuration options (see table below) are always controlled via the helm chart.

ℹ️ *For the full list of configurable parameters in the Datree helm chart, click [here](https://github.com/datreeio/admission-webhook-datree#values)*

### Configure options

To set/change one or more options, change the desired parameter(s) in your `values.yaml` file, then apply it:

```yaml
# values.yaml
datree:
  enforce: true
```

```terminal
helm upgrade -n datree -f values.yaml datree-webhook datree-webhook/datree-admission-webhook
```

---

## Set/change token

To change your token, you can simply change the `datree.token` parameter in your `values.yaml` file and apply it using the command mentioned above.  

If you're looking for a more secure approach, use the `datree.existingSecret` parameter:
  1. Create a `Secret` object containing your token and apply it to your cluster.
  2. Set the Secret's data in the `datree.existingSecret` parameter in your `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
# values.yaml
datree:
  existingSecret:
    name: <secret-name>
    key: <secret-key>
```
3. Apply `values.yaml` to your cluster.

:::info NOTE
If both options are set, `datree.existingSecret` will take precedence.
:::

---

## Bypass permissions

You can configure Datree to allow certain users/groups/ServiceAccounts to bypass a failing policy check.  

To add entities to the bypass permissions list, add/change the `datree.bypassPermissions` parameter in your `values.yaml` file. For example:  

```yaml
datree:
  bypassPermissions:
      userAccounts:
        - "minikube"
      serviceAccounts:
        - "system:serviceaccount:default:srv"
      groups:
        - developers
```

---

## Custom skipping

Datree can be configured to skip certain rules/resources by using a dedicated `ConfigMap`.  
The `ConfigMap` is a part of the Datree Helm chart, under the parameter `datree.customSkipList`.  
You can use it to skip a `namespace`, `kind`, `name`, or any combination of the three.

To add an entry to the `ConfigMap`:

**1.** In your `values.yaml` file, add the following parameter:

```yaml
datree:
  customSkipList:
    - "(.*);(.*);(.*)" # "namespace;kind;name"
```

Replace `(.*);(.*);(.*)` with your desired values (see examples below). You can use a regular expression for any of the aformentioned properties.

**2.** Apply your `values.yaml` file:

```terminal
helm upgrade -n datree -f values.yaml datree-webhook datree-webhook/datree-admission-webhook
```

:::info NOTE
By default, Datree skips all resources with a name starting with `aws-node`.  
This entry is already included in the default `values.yaml` file.
:::

### Example patterns

The following pattern will cause Datree to skip all resources in the namespace 'myNs':

```
myNs;(.*);(.*)
```

The following pattern will cause Datree to skip all resources of kind `ServiceAccount`, regardless of their namespace:

```
(.*);ServiceAccount;(.*)
```

The following pattern will cause Datree to skip all resources in all namespaces if the resource name starts with the prefix 'appName-':

```
(.*);(.*);(^appName-.*)
```

---

## Ignore a namespace

Add the label `"admission.datree/validate=skip"` to the configuration of the namespace you would like to ignore:

```terminal
kubectl label namespaces default "admission.datree/validate=skip"
```

To delete the label and resume running the datree webhook on the namespace again:

```terminal
kubectl label namespaces default "admission.datree/validate-"
```

---

## Skip specific rules for a single object

To skip a rule for a specific object, add the following annotation to its manifest:

```yaml
datree.skip/[identifier]: [message]
```

**identifier** - the unique rule identifier.  
**message** - optional text to be presented in the policy check output (CLI and activity-log tab at the dashboard). <br/><br/>

To obtain identifiers of _built-in rules_, go to your [dashboard](https://app.datree.io/cli/policies/) and click on the 'i' icon of your desired rule:

![rule_i](/img/configuration/behavior/1.png)

This will lead you to the documentation of the rule, where you will find the identifier:

![rule_identifier_docs](/img/configuration/behavior/2.png)

Identifiers of [_custom rules_](/custom-rules/custom-rules-overview) can be found in the policy.yaml file, when in Policy-as-code mode. For example:

```yaml
customRules:
  - identifier: CUSTOM_WORKLOAD_INCORRECT_ENVIRONMENT_LABELS
    name: Ensure correct environment labels are used [CUSTOM RULE]
    defaultMessageOnFailure: Use only approved environment labels ('prod', 'staging' and 'test')
    schema:
```

#### Example of a Deployment with skipped rules:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: rss-site
  namespace: test
  labels:
    environment: prod
    app: web
  annotations:
    datree.skip/WORKLOAD_INVALID_LABELS_VALUE: irrelevant for deployments, skipping.
    datree.skip/CONTAINERS_MISSING_LIVENESSPROBE_KEY: irrelevant for prod environment, skipping.
```

:::info Note
`annotations` have a character limit - the key and value of an annotation cannot exceed 63 characters each.  
For more information, see the [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/#syntax-and-character-set)
:::

## Customize warnings (logs)

By default, Datree prints a warning for the following types of events:
* **Passed policy checks** - resources that passed the policy check. Helm chart param: `passedPolicyCheck`.
* **Failed policy checks** - resources that failed the policy check. Helm chart param: `failedPolicyCheck`.
* **RBAC-bypassed** - resources that were [bypassed](/configuration/behavior#bypass-permissions) . Helm chart param: `RBACBypassed`.
* **Skipped resources** - resources that were skipped for any reason. Helm chart param: `skipped`.

An example of a failed policy check warning:  
![failed_policy_check](/img/configuration/behavior/warning-example.png)


The Helm chart parameter `datree.enabledWarnings` allows you to customize which types of warnings are printed, simply delete the ones you do not wish to see, and apply your `values.yaml` file.

---

## Update

To update Datree to the latest version, run the following commands:

```terminal
helm repo update
helm upgrade -n datree datree-webhook datree-webhook/datree-admission-webhook --set datree.token=<YOUR_DATREE_TOKEN> --set datree.clusterName=<DESIRED_CLUSTER_NAME> --debug
```

:::tip Gitops approach
To avoid having to write your token and cluster name explicity, you can use a `values.yaml` file to hold them, then apply it using the `-f` flag when upgrading Datree.  
For example:
```yaml
# values.yaml
datree:
  token: a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9
  clusterName: aws-stg1
```
:::

---

## Multiple policies

You may want to use different policies for different namespaces. To do so, follow these steps (examples below):
1. Instruct Datree to be [configured from the Helm chart](/configuration/behavior#dashboard-vs-helm-chart-configuration) by setting `datree.configFromHelm` to `true`.
2. Delete the `datree.policy` parameter from the chart, and instead add `datree.multiplePolicies`, which is an array of objects.
3. Each item in the array needs to have the following parameters:
  * `policy` (*mandatory*) - the name of the policy (e.g. "Starter").
  * `namespaces` - an object containing the following parameters:
    * `includePatterns` (*mandatory*) - an array of regex patterns for namespaces to include.
    * `excludePatterns` - an array of regex patterns for namespaces to exclude.

The following example will set the policy "Starter" for all namespaces except "security":
```yaml
datree:
  configFromHelm: true
  # policy: "Starter" (This parameter should be deleted)
  multiplePolicies:
    - policy: "Starter"
      namespaces:
        includePatterns:
          - ".*"
        excludePatterns:
          - "security"
```

The following example will set the policy "CIS" for namespaces "ns1" and "ns2", and the policy "Starter" for namespace "ns3":
```yaml
datree:
  configFromHelm: true
  multiplePolicies:
    - policy: "CIS"
      namespaces:
        includePattern:
          - "ns1"
          - "ns2" 
    - policy: "Starter"
      namespaces:
        includePattern:
          - "ns3"
```

:::caution Using a policy in more than one namespace
Each policy can be written only once in the `multiplePolicies` array.  
To use the same policy for more than one namespace, specify the desired namespaces under the `includePattern` key (see "ns1" and "ns2" in the example above).
:::

## Uninstall

To uninstall Datree, run the following commands:

```terminal
helm uninstall datree-webhook -n datree
kubectl delete ns datree
```
