:::tip
When working with Github workflows, the best way to incorporate Datree is to use our official [Github action](https://github.com/datreeio/action-datree).  
:::

## TO-DO list for setting-up Datree in your CI

- [x] Get your [account token](/dashboard/account-token)
- [ ] Set DATREE_TOKEN as a [secret/environment variable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)
- [ ] Add datree to your CI script

## CI config example

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
    
env:
  DATREE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DATREE_TOKEN }} 

jobs:
  k8sPolicyCheck:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
      - name: Run Datree Policy Check
        uses: datreeio/action-datree@main
        with:
          path: '**/*.yaml'
          cliArguments: '--only-k8s-files'
```
