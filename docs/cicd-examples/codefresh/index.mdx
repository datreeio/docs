:::tip
When working with Codefresh workflows, the best way to incorporate Datree is to use our official [Codefresh plugin](https://github.com/datreeio/codefresh-datree).  
:::

## TO-DO list for setting-up Datree in your CI

- [x] Get your [account token](/dashboard/account-token)
- [ ] Set DATREE_TOKEN as a [shared secret variable](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/shared-configuration/)
- [ ] Add datree to your CI script

## CI config example

```yaml
version: "1.0"
stages:
  - "clone"
  - "datree-policy-check"

steps:
  clone:
    title: "Cloning repository"
    type: "git-clone"
    repo: "myOrg/myRepo"
    revision: "${{CF_BRANCH}}"
    git: "github"
    stage: "clone"
    
  datree-policy-check:
    title: Run Datree policy check
    type: datree/datree-policy-check
    stage: "datree-policy-check"
    arguments:
      DATREE_TOKEN: "${{DATREE_TOKEN}}"
      INPUT_PATH: 'fileName.yaml'
```
