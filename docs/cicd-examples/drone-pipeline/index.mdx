:::tip
When working with Drone pipelines, the best way to incorporate Datree is to use our official [Drone plugin](https://github.com/datreeio/drone-datree).  
:::

## TO-DO list for setting-up Datree in your CI

- [x] Get your [account token](/setup/account-token)
- [ ] Set DATREE_TOKEN as a [secret/environment variable](https://docs.drone.io/secret/repository/)
- [ ] Add datree to your CI script

## CI config example

```yaml
kind: pipeline
type: docker
name: default

platform:
  os: linux
  arch: arm64

steps:
- name: datree-policy-check  
  image: datree/drone-datree
  settings:
    token:
      from_secret: datree_token
    path: "someDirectory/someFile.yaml"

  when:
    event:
    - push
    - pull_request
```
