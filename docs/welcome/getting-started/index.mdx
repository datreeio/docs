Datree prevents misconfigurations by blocking resources that do not meet your policy.

## Quickstart

Install Datree to get insights on the status of your cluster and enforce your desired policies on new resources.

:::caution Note
By default, Datree does not block misconfigured resources, it only monitors and alerts about them.  
To enable **enforcement mode**, see the [behavior](/configuration/behavior) page.
:::

## Install Datree with Helm

### 1. Add the Datree Helm repository
Run the following command in your terminal:
```terminal
helm repo add datree-webhook https://datreeio.github.io/admission-webhook-datree
helm repo update
```

### 2. Install Datree on your cluster
Replace `<DATREE_TOKEN>` with the token from your [dashboard](https://app.datree.io/), and run the following command in your terminal:  
```terminal
helm install -n datree datree-webhook datree-webhook/datree-admission-webhook --debug \
--create-namespace \
--set datree.token=<DATREE_TOKEN> \
--set datree.clusterName=$(kubectl config current-context)
```

This will create a new namespace (datree), where Datreeâ€™s services and application resources will reside. `datree.token` is used to connect your dashboard to your cluster. Note that the installation can take up to 5 minutes.

:::info
The webhook officially supports and has been tested with Kubernetes version 1.19 and higher.
:::

### 3. You're all set! ðŸŽ‰
Datree will now run in the background, scanning your cluster for misconfigurations. A report will be sent to the email connected to your account.  

### What's next?

You can now proceed to [configure](/configuration/behavior) Datree according to your needs.
