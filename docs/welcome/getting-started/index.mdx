Prevent Kubernetes misconfigurations from reaching production (again ðŸ˜¤ )! From code to production, Datree provides an E2E policy enforcement solution to run automatic checks for rule violations.
Datree can be used as a cluster guardrail, on the command line, or even as a kubectl plugin to run policies against Kubernetes objects.
