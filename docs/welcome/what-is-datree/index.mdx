[Datree](https://www.datree.io/) prevents Kubernetes misconfigurations from reaching production.

As your organization's infrastructure owner, the product's stability is your primary concern. Toolchain engineering and architecture gets pushed to the wayside because you must constantly put out fires configured in the development stage.

## Preventing outages

We've experienced this precise challenge, which is why we developed Datree. We wanted to delegate responsibilities to developers, but didn’t want to worry about production outages. That’s why we built a solution to help us implement an abstraction layer with automated checks (with both built-in and customizable policies) to educate developers and manage the Kubernetes configuration changes they perform.

## Serving DevOps

Datree is a [CLI tool](/setup/cli-arguments) that supports Kubernetes owners in their roles, by preventing developers from making errors in Kubernetes configurations that can cause clusters to fail in production. Our CLI solution is open source, enabling it to be supported by the Kubernetes community.

It's far more effective than manual processes, which can lead to alert fatigue in developers already swamped with work.

## Automated and simplified

In addition to what it offers DevOps, Datree provides developers with a simplified Kubernetes deployment experience so they don’t need to remember the many rules governing development. Instead of relying on human observation and memory, developers are alerted early on, as soon as a misconfiguration takes place, and educated to prevent it from recurring. This process enables them to catch mistakes before their code moves to the next stage—and to become better developers.
