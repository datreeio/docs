## Rule Skipping

Rule skipping allows you to instrument your policy evaluation process, and specify which of your rules should not apply to a specific resource. 

### Skipping rules within the admission webhook

The admission webhook can be configured to skip certain rules by using a dedicated `ConfigMap` (see example below).  
* The `ConfigMap` must be named 'webhook-scanning-filters.yaml' and must reside in the 'datree' namespace.
* Enter the resources you wish to skip under the `data.skiplist` key, in the format of *namespace;resourceKind;resourceName*.
* You can use `(.*?)` as a wild-card for any of the aformentioned properties.

:::info
After creating/changing your `ConfigMap`, run `kubectl rollout restart deployment -n datree` to restart the webhook and apply your changes.
:::

The following example will cause the webhook to skip all resources of type `ServiceAccount` in all namespaces, regardless of their name:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: webhook-scanning-filters
  namespace: datree
data:
  skiplist: |
    - (.*?);ServiceAccount;(.*?)
```

The following example will skip all resources in the namespace 'myNs':
```yaml
data:
  skiplist: |
    - myNs;(.*?);(.*?)
```

### Skipping rules when using the CLI

Rule skipping in the CLI is allowed for a specific resource instance. Skipping rules in a specific namespace or container is currently not supported.

Skipping is done by adding the following annotation to a given resource manifest:  
> datree.skip/**[identifier]**: **[message]**

**identifier** - the unique rule identifier.  
**message** - optional text to be presented in the policy check output (CLI and history tab at the dashboard).  <br/><br/>

To obtain identifiers of *built-in rules*, go to your [dashboard](https://app.datree.io/cli/policies/) and click on the 'i' icon of your desired rule:  

![rule_i](/img/setup/policy-customization/1.png)

This will lead you to the documentation of the rule, where you will find the identifier:  

![rule_identifier_docs](/img/setup/policy-customization/2.png)

Identifiers of *custom rules* can be found in the policy.yaml file, when in Policy-as-code mode.  For example:  
```yaml
customRules:
  - identifier: CUSTOM_WORKLOAD_INCORRECT_ENVIRONMENT_LABELS
    name: Ensure correct environment labels are used [CUSTOM RULE]
    defaultMessageOnFailure: Use only approved environment labels ('prod', 'staging' and 'test')
    schema:
```

### Example YAML with skipped rules:  
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: rss-site
  namespace: test
  labels:
    environment: prod
    app: web
  annotations:
    datree.skip/WORKLOAD_INVALID_LABELS_VALUE: irrelevant for deployments, skipping.
    datree.skip/CONTAINERS_MISSING_LIVENESSPROBE_KEY: irrelevant for prod environment, skipping.
```

:::info Note
`annotations` have a character limit - the key and value of an annotation cannot exceed 63 characters each.
