## What is a token

The token connects your policy checks to your [Centralized policy](/setup/centralized-policy), which determines your available policies.  
Additionally, the token allows your CLI to report your policy check history to the dashboard.  
When a policy check is triggered, Datree reads your account token from the config file (`~/.datree/config.yaml`).

**Each token has the following properties:**

- **Label:** the name of the token, as presented in the history tab in your dashboard.
- **Type:** can be set to either *read* or *write*, used to define the permissions for updating your account policies.

:::info
Tokens are immutable. To change one of the token's properties, a new token needs to be created and set in the CLI.

## Connect your dashboard to the CLI

### 1. Get your account token from the dashboard

- Log into your account

- Go to "SETTINGS" (click on the avatar in the upper-right corner)  
![settings](/img/setup/account-token/1.png)

- Copy your account token  
![get_token](/img/setup/account-token/2.png)

### 2. Set your token in the CLI

To set your token, simply run the following command in your terminal using the same token you copied in the previous step:

```terminal
datree config set token <token>
```

This will replace the token inside the config file (`~/.datree/config.yaml`)

## Token Management

### Creating new tokens
A single account can have multiple tokens. Creating new tokens is done via the Token Management tab in your dashboard settings.
:::info
Policy checks executed with a certain token are reported only to the dashboard of that token's creator.

## Using tokens in your CI
Setting your token in your CI is done using the `DATREE_TOKEN` environment variable. The Datree CLI automatically checks this variable and uses its value as the token.  
See our [CI/CD section](/cicd-examples) for examples using popular platforms.
