The following options are available for configuring Datree's behavior:

### Options

    # The token used to link the CLI to your dashboard.
    token: <DATREE_TOKEN>
    # The name of the policy to check, e.g: staging. (string, optional)
    policy: ""
    # Display 'How to Fix' link for failed rules in output. (boolean ,optional)
    verbose: ""
    # The format output of the policy check results: yaml, json, xml, simple, JUnit. (string ,optional)
    output: ""
    # Donâ€™t send policy checks metadata to the backend. (boolean ,optional)
    noRecord: ""
    # Block resources that fail the policy check. (boolean ,optional)
    enforce: ""

### Set/change token

---

### Ignore a namespace
Add the label `"admission.datree/validate=skip"` to the configuration of the namespace you would like to ignore:

```terminal
kubectl label namespaces default "admission.datree/validate=skip"
```

To delete the label and resume running the datree webhook on the namespace again:

```terminal
kubectl label namespaces default "admission.datree/validate-"
```

---

### Skip specific rules for a single object

To skip a rule for a specific object, add the following annotation to its manifest:  
> datree.skip/**[identifier]**: **[message]**

**identifier** - the unique rule identifier.  
**message** - optional text to be presented in the policy check output (CLI and history tab at the dashboard).  <br/><br/>

To obtain identifiers of *built-in rules*, go to your [dashboard](https://app.datree.io/cli/policies/) and click on the 'i' icon of your desired rule:  

![rule_i](/img/setup/policy-customization/1.png)

This will lead you to the documentation of the rule, where you will find the identifier:  

![rule_identifier_docs](/img/setup/policy-customization/2.png)

Identifiers of *custom rules* can be found in the policy.yaml file, when in Policy-as-code mode.  For example:  
```yaml
customRules:
  - identifier: CUSTOM_WORKLOAD_INCORRECT_ENVIRONMENT_LABELS
    name: Ensure correct environment labels are used [CUSTOM RULE]
    defaultMessageOnFailure: Use only approved environment labels ('prod', 'staging' and 'test')
    schema:
```

---
### Example YAML with skipped rules:  
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: rss-site
  namespace: test
  labels:
    environment: prod
    app: web
  annotations:
    datree.skip/WORKLOAD_INVALID_LABELS_VALUE: irrelevant for deployments, skipping.
    datree.skip/CONTAINERS_MISSING_LIVENESSPROBE_KEY: irrelevant for prod environment, skipping.
```

`annotations` have a character limit - the key and value of an annotation cannot exceed 63 characters each.
