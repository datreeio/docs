title: ☑️ Prevent container security vulnerability (CVE-2021-25741)
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-container-security-vulnerability-cve-2021-25741
---

A vulnerability has been discovered in Kubernetes that allows users to create a container with subpath volume mounts to access files and directories outside of the volume, including the host filesystem ([NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-25741) severity of this issue: **High**).

Users who are able to exploit it can gain access to the host filesystem and compromise the Kubernetes node along with all the other running containers.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**):** Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** False

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINER_CVE2021_25741_INCORRECT_SUBPATH_KEY

---

## This rule will fail

If the VolumeSubpath feature is used in your pods. This means having the property object `subPath` in your configuration files.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
        name: site-data
        subPath: mysql
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Prevent container security vulnerability (CVE-2021-25741) [1 occurrence]
💡 Forbidden property object `subPath` - malicious users can gain access to files & directories outside of the volume
```

## How to fix this failure

CVE-2021-25741 was fixed in the following Kubernetes versions:

- v1.22.2
- v1.21.5
- v1.20.11
- v1.19.15

To mitigate this vulnerability without upgrading kubelet, you can disable the VolumeSubpath feature gate on kubelet and kube-apiserver, and remove any existing pods making use of the feature.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
        name: site-data
```
