title: ‚òëÔ∏è Prevent use of the `cluster-admin` role
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-cluster-admin-role

import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

Kubernetes provides a set of default roles where RBAC is used. Some of these roles such as cluster-admin provide wide-ranging privileges which should only be applied where absolutely necessary. Roles such as cluster-admin allow super-user access to perform any action on any resource.  
When used in a `ClusterRoleBinding`, it gives full control over every resource in the cluster and in all namespaces. When used in a `RoleBinding`, it gives full control over every resource in the rolebinding's namespace, including the namespace itself.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**):** RoleBinding / ClusterRoleBinding

**Complexity:** **easy** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** CIS_INVALID_ROLE_CLUSTER_ADMIN

## This rule will fail

If the `cluster-admin` role is used:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: cluster-admin
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Prevent use of the `cluster-admin` role [1 occurrence]
üí° Incorrect value for key `name` - the RBAC role `cluster-admin` provides wide-ranging powers over the environment and should be used only where needed
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Use a more restrictive role:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: role:viewer
```
