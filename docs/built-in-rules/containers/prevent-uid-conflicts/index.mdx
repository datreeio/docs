title: ☑️ Prevent containers from accessing host files by using high UIDs
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-uid-conflicts
---

It's recommended for containers to run under UIDs that are not used on the host system. With a high UID number, a container is blocked from accessing host-based files even if it manages to gain access to a host's file system.

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** False

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_RUNASUSER_VALUE_LOWUID

---

## This rule will fail

If `runAsUser` is set to a number lower than _10000_

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 100
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```none
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Prevent containers from accessing host files by using high UIDs [1 occurrence]
💡 Incorrect value for key `runAsUser` - value should be above 9999 to reduce the likelihood that the UID is already taken
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Set `runAsUser` to a number bigger than 9999

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 25000
```
