title: ‚òëÔ∏è Ensure container probes have an initial delay configured
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-initial-probe-delay
---

Probes have a number of fields that are used to control the behavior of liveness and readiness checks. A defect was found in one of these fields causing it to be ignored, and was corrected in Kubernetes v1.20.  
To prevent such cases where unknown default behavior is used, we suggest to explicitly set these fields with your desired values. See the *Read more* section below for more information.  
The field `initialDelaySeconds` defines the number of seconds after the container has started before liveness or readiness probes are initiated. It has a default value of 0 seconds, and a minimum value of 0 seconds.

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** False

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_INITIALDELAYSECONDS_VALUE

---

## This rule will fail

If a container has a `livenessProbe`, `readinessProbe` and/or `startupProbe` configured, but the field `initialDelaySeconds` is not configured or has a value smaller than 0

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - readinessProbe:
        timeoutSeconds: 1
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Ensure container probes have an initial delay configured [1 occurrence]
üí° Incorrect value for key `initialDelaySeconds` - set to prevent unwanted default initial delay behavior
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Each each container probe has a configured `initialDelaySeconds` property with a minimum value of 0

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - readinessProbe:
        initialDelaySeconds: 0
```
