title: ☑️ Prevent containers from having root access capabilities
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-privileged-containers
---

Processes running in privileged containers have access to host-level resources such as the file system. These containers are much more secure when their access is limited to the pod level.

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_PRIVILEGED_VALUE_TRUE

---

## This rule will fail

If `privileged` is set as _true_

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
      securityContext:
        privileged: true
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```none
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Prevent containers from having root access capabilities [1 occurrence]
💡 Incorrect value for key `privileged` - this mode will allow the container the same access as processes running on the host
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Set `privileged` to \*false **or** remove this property completely

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
      securityContext:
        privileged: false
```
