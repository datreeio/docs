title: ☑️ Ensure each container has a configured CPU limit
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-cpu-limit
---

CPU limits enable you to use CPU resources efficiently by restricting the maximum amount of CPU available to the pods running in your cluster.

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_MISSING_CPU_LIMIT_KEY

---

## This rule will fail

If a container doesn't have a CPU limit configured

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```none
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Ensure each container has a configured CPU limit [1 occurrence]
💡 Missing property object `limits.cpu` - value should be within the accepted boundaries recommended by the organization
```

---

## How to fix this failure

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: '500m'
```
