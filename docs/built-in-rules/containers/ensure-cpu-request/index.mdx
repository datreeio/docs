slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-cpu-request
---

CPU requests enable you to use CPU resources efficiently and to allocate a guaranteed minimum of computing resources for the pods running in your cluster.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_MISSING_CPU_REQUEST_KEY

---

## This rule will fail

If a container doesn't have a CPU request configured

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Ensure each container has a configured CPU request [1 occurrence]
💡 Missing property object `requests.cpu` - value should be within the accepted boundaries recommended by the organization
```

## How to fix this failure

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "250m"
```
