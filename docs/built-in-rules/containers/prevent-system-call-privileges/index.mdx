title: ‚òëÔ∏è Prevent containers from having unnecessary system call privileges
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-system-call-privileges

Seccomp is a mechanism to restrict the actions available within the container by restricting system calls that a process could make. The seccomp profile of a container is set within its `securityContext`, and can be set at pod level or at container level.  
Running containers/Pods with the seccomp profile `unconfined` means one less isolation layer to protect your cluster. This is advised against by the security community, as it can give attackers dangerous privileges.  
No container in your cluster should run unconfined, especially in production environments.

In Kubernetes versions earlier than 1.24, the default seccomp profile of containers is `unconfined`, which means that all pods that do not specify a seccomp profile will be susceptible to this threat.

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** False

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_SECCOMP_PROFILE

## This rule will fail

If a `seccompProfile` is not configured, or has a type other than `Localhost` or `RuntimeDefault`:

```yaml
spec:
  securityContext:
    seccompProfile: 
      type: Unconfined
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Prevent containers from having unnecessary system call privileges [1 occurrence]
üí° Incorrect value for key `seccompProfile` - set an explicit value to prevent malicious use of system calls within the container
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Set the `seccompProfile` type to `Localhost` or `RuntimeDefault`:

```yaml
spec:
  securityContext:
    seccompProfile: 
      type: RuntimeDefault
```
