title: ☑️ Prevent containers from sharing the host's IPC namespace
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-using-host-ipc
---

By default, containers only share IPC resources within the same pod. When a container is allowed to share its host's IPC namespace, it has access to the same inter-process mechanisms as other processes running outside of the container runtime.

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** False

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_HOSTIPC_VALUE_TRUE

---

## This rule will fail

If `hostIPC` is set to _true_

```yaml
spec:
  hostIPC: true
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```none
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Prevent containers from sharing the host’s IPC namespace [1 occurrence]
💡 Incorrect value for key `hostIPC` - running on the host’s IPC namespace can be (maliciously) used to interact with other processes running outside the container
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Set the `hostIPC` to _false_ or remove it completely

```yaml
spec:
  hostIPC: false
```
