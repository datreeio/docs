title: ‚òëÔ∏è Ensure each container has a configured memory limit
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-memory-limit
---

Memory limits enable you to use memory resources efficiently. By setting memory limits, you restrict the maximum amount of memory available to the pods running in your cluster.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_MISSING_MEMORY_LIMIT_KEY

---

## This rule will fail

If a container doesn't have a memory limit configured

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Ensure each container has a configured memory limit [1 occurrence]
üí° Missing property object `limits.memory` - value should be within the accepted boundaries recommended by the organization
```

---

## How to fix this failure

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: "128Mi"
```
