title: ‚òëÔ∏è Prevent containers from sharing the host‚Äôs network namespace
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-using-host-network
---

When a container is allowed to share its host's network namespace, it can access local network listeners and leverage it to probe the host's local network.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** False

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_HOSTNETWORK_VALUE_TRUE

---

## This rule will fail

If `hostNetwork` is set to _true_

```yaml
spec:
  hostNetwork: true
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Prevent containers from sharing the host‚Äôs network namespace [1 occurrence]
üí° Incorrect value for key `hostNetwork` - running on the host‚Äôs network namespace can allow a compromised container to sniff network traffic
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Set the `hostNetwork` to _false_ or remove it completely

```yaml
spec:
  hostNetwork: false
```
