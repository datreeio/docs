title: ☑️ Ensure each container has a configured readiness probe
slug: /built-in-rules/containers/ensure-readiness-probe
---

Readiness probes allow Kubernetes to determine when a pod is ready to accept traffic. This ensures that client requests will not be routed to pods that are unable to process them.

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_MISSING_READINESSPROBE_KEY

---

## This rule will fail

If a container doesn't have `readinessProbe` configured

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```none
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Ensure each container has a configured readiness probe [1 occurrence]
💡 Missing property object `readinessProbe` - add a properly configured readinessProbe to notify kubelet your Pods are ready for traffic
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Configure a readiness probe with an HTTP request, TCP protocol or exec command (the least recommended option)

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
      readinessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /healthz
          port: 8080
```

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
      readinessProbe:
        tcpSocket:
          port: 8080
```

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
      readinessProbe:
        exec:
          command:
            - cat
            - /tmp/healthy
```
