title: ‚òëÔ∏è Ensure each container probe has a configured minimum success threshold
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-probe-min-success-threshold
---

Probes have a number of fields that are used to control the behavior of liveness, readiness and startup checks. Though these fields have default values, we suggest to explicitly set them with your desired values.  
One reason to do so is to prevent cases where unknown default behavior is used. For example, a defect was found in one of these fields causing it to be ignored, and was corrected in Kubernetes v1.20.  

The field `successThreshold` defines the minimum consecutive successes required for the probe to be considered successful after having failed. It has a default value of 1, a minimum value of 1, and must have a value of 1 for liveness and startup probes.

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** False

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_SUCCESSTHRESHOLD_VALUE

## This rule will fail

If a container has a `livenessProbe`, `readinessProbe` and/or `startupProbe` configured, but the field `successThreshold` is not configured or has a value smaller than 1. For liveness and startup probes, this rule will also fail if the value of `successThreshold` is not 1

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myContainer
      readinessProbe:
        successThreshold: 0
```
```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myContainer
      livenessProbe:
        successThreshold: 2
```
```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myContainer
      startupProbe:
        periodSeconds: 1
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Ensure each container probe has a configured minimum success threshold [1 occurrence]
üí° Incorrect value for key `successThreshold` - set explicitly to control when a probe is considered successful after having failed
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Each container probe should have a configured `successThreshold` property with a valid value (see above for limitations)

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myContainer
      readinessProbe:
        successThreshold: 2
```
```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myContainer
      livenessProbe:
        successThreshold: 1
```
```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myContainer
      startupProbe:
        successThreshold: 1
```
