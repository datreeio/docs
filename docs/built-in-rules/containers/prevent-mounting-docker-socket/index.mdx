title: ☑️ Prevent containers from mounting Docker socket
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-mounting-docker-socket
displayed_sidebar: docs2
---

It is recommended to disallow Docker socket access to all pods running on a cluster. When a container has access to the Docker socket, it can effectively manage other containers on the host.

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** False

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_PATH_VALUE_DOCKERSOCKET

---

## This rule will fail

If one of the `volumes` is targeting the _/var/run/docker.sock_ `path`

```yaml
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: docker-sock-volume
      hostPath:
        path: /var/run/docker.sock
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/run/docker.sock
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Prevent containers from mounting Docker socket [1 occurrence]
💡 Incorrect value for key `path` - avoid mounting the docker.socket becasue it can allow container breakout
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Avoid mounting the Docker socket

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
```
