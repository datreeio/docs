title: ☑️ Ensure each container has a configured memory request
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-memory-request
---

Memory requests allow you to use memory resources efficiently and allow you to allocate a guaranteed minimum of computing resources for the pods running in your cluster.

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_MISSING_MEMORY_REQUEST_KEY

---

## This rule will fail

If a container doesn't have a memory request configured

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```none
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Ensure each container has a configured memory request [1 occurrence]
💡 Missing property object `requests.memory` - value should be within the accepted boundaries recommended by the organization
```

---

## How to fix this failure

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: '64Mi'
```
