import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

The `impersonate` privilege allows a subject to impersonate other users gaining their rights to the cluster. The `bind` privilege allows the subject to add a binding to a cluster role or role which escalates their effective permissions in the cluster. The `escalate` privilege allows a subject to modify cluster roles to which they are bound, increasing their rights to that level.  

Each of these permissions has the potential to allow for privilege escalation to cluster-admin level.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**):** Role / ClusterRole

**Complexity:** **medium** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** CIS_INVALID_VALUE_BIND_IMPERSONATE_ESCALATE

## This rule will fail

If the `bind`/`impersonate`/`escalate` permissions are used:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Role
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["impersonate"]
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Prevent role privilege escalation [1 occurrence]
üí° Invalid value for key `verbs` - do not use `bind`/`impersonate`/`escalate` to prevent privilege escalation
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Remove the aforementioned permissions:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```
