title: ‚òëÔ∏è Prevent CronJob from executing jobs concurrently
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-cronjob-concurrency

import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

By default, the cron job allows concurrently running jobs but generally speaking, the behavior of your cron jobs will be more deterministic if you prevent them from running concurrently. Allowing concurrent cron jobs often requires locking mechanisms (to avoid race conditions) in addition to startup/cleanup handling.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **CronJob

**Complexity:** **easy** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** CRONJOB_MISSING_CONCURRENCYPOLICY_KEY

---

## This rule will fail

If a CronJob doesn't have `concurrencyPolicy` set or `concurrencyPolicy` is set to _Allow_

```yaml
kind: CronJob
spec:
  schedule: "*/1 * * * *"
```

```yaml
kind: CronJob
spec:
  concurrencyPolicy: Allow
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Prevent CronJob from executing jobs concurrently [1 occurrence]
üí° Missing property object `concurrencyPolicy` - the behavior will be more deterministic when the jobs run one at a time
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Set `concurrencyPolicy` to either _Forbid_ or _Replace_

```yaml
kind: CronJob
spec:
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
```

```yaml
kind: CronJob
spec:
  concurrencyPolicy: Replace
```
