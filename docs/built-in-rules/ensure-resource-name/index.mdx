title: ‚òëÔ∏è Ensure resource has a valid configured name
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-resource-name

import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

`metadata.name` OR `metadata.generateName` is a mandatory property in every K8s resource type. 
Validation that this property exists occurs is on the k8s server-side only, and is not enforced as part of the official schema. 
Therefore, a YAML without this property will pass k8s schema validation, but will fail when pushed into a cluster (i.e. when running kubectl apply/create).  

Most resources require a name that complies with DNS subdomain names, as defined [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names). This means that the name must:
* contain at most 63 characters
* contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters or '-'
* start with an alphanumeric character
* end with an alphanumeric character


**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**):** All

**Complexity:** **medium** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** RESOURCE_MISSING_NAME

## This rule will fail

If a resource does not contain one of the propreties `name` or `generateName`, or if the name is not valid:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  namespace: "myGreatNamespace"
```

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: "thisIsAn!nvalidName"
  namespace: "myGreatNamespace"
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Ensure resource has a valid configured name [1 occurrence]
üí° Invalid/missing key `name` or `generateName` - one of them must be set with a valid value to apply a resource to a cluster
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Set either `name` or `generateName` and give it a valid value:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: "myGreatIngress"
  namespace: "myGreatNamespace"
```
