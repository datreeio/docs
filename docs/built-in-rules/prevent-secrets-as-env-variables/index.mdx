import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

Kubernetes supports mounting secrets as data volumes or as environment variables.  
It is reasonably common for application code to log out its environment (particularly in the event of an error). This will include any secret values passed in as environment variables, so secrets can easily be exposed to any user or entity who has access to the logs.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**):** Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Complexity:** **hard** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** CIS_INVALID_KEY_SECRETKEYREF_SECRETREF

## This rule will fail

If secrets are used as environment variables:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
    - env:
      - name: SECRET_PASSWORD
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: mysecret
            key: password
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Prevent use of secrets as environment variables [1 occurrence]
üí° Incorrect key `secretKeyRef`/`secretRef` - mount secrets as files and not as env variables to avoid exposing sensitive data
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Mount secrets as files instead:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: secret-volume
    secret:
      secretName: ssh-key-secret
  containers:
  - name: ssh-test-container
    image: mySshImage
    volumeMounts:
    - name: secret-volume
      readOnly: true
      mountPath: "/etc/secret-volume"
```
