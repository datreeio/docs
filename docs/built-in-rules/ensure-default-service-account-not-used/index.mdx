title: ‚òëÔ∏è Ensure that default service accounts are not actively used
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-default-service-account-not-used
---

import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

Kubernetes provides a default service account which is used by cluster workloads where no specific service account is assigned to the pod. Where access to the Kubernetes API from a pod is required, a specific service account should be created for that pod, and rights granted to that service account.  

The default service account should be configured such that it does not provide a service account token and does not have any explicit rights assignments.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**):** ServiceAccount

**Complexity:** **easy** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** CIS_INVALID_VALUE_AUTOMOUNTSERVICEACCOUNTTOKEN

---

## This rule will fail

If a default service account does not have the `automountServiceAccountToken` key set to `false`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: default
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Ensure that default service accounts are not actively used [1 occurrence]
üí° Invalid value for key `automountServiceAccountToken` - set to `false` to ensure rights can be more easily audited
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Add the `automountServiceAccountToken` key and set it to `false`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: default
automountServiceAccountToken: false
```
