title: ☑️ Ensure each container fully utilizes CPU with no limitations
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-no-cpu-limit
---

A container's CPU request typically defines a priority. If several different containers (CGroups) want to run on a contended system, workloads with larger CPU requests are allocated more CPU time than workloads with small requests.  
Kubernetes configures CPU shares for a CGroup. At times of congestion, the CFS will allocate more CPU time to the higher priority processes.  
In the absence of a CPU limit, the request acts as a priority for how much relative CPU time containers get. This allows your workloads to use the CPU without an artificial limit or starvation.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** False

**Policy as code identifier:** EKS_INVALID_CPU_LIMIT

---

## This rule will fail

If a container has a CPU limit configured:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "128Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "128Mi"
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Ensure each container fully utilizes CPU with no limitations [1 occurrence]
💡 Invalid key `limits.cpu` - refrain from setting a CPU limit to better utilize the CPU and prevent starvation
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Do not configure a CPU limit:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "128Mi"
```
