title: ‚òëÔ∏è Prevent SELinux containers from setting a role
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-selinux-containers-role
---

SELinux defines access controls for the applications, processes, and files on a system. SELinux uses security policies, which are a set of rules that tell SELinux what can or can't be accessed, to enforce the access allowed by a policy.  
SELinux options can be used to escalate privileges and should not be allowed.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** False

**Policy as code identifier:** EKS_INVALID_SELINUXOPTIONS_ROLE_VALUE

---

## This rule will fail

If an SELinux `role` is set:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - securityContext:
        seLinuxOptions:
          role: usr
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Prevent SELinux containers from setting a role [1 occurrence]
üí° Invalid key `role` - refrain from setting this key to prevent potential access to the host filesystem
```

---

## How to fix this failure

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - securityContext:
      seLinuxOptions:
        type: container_kvm_t
```
