title: ‚òëÔ∏è Ensure hostPath volume mounts are read-only
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-hostpath-mounts-readonly
---

A `hostPath` volume mounts a file or directory from the host node's filesystem into a Pod.  

By default pods that run as root will have write access to the file system exposed by `hostPath`. This could allow an attacker to modify the `kubelet` settings, create symbolic links to directories or files not directly exposed by the hostPath, install ssh keys, read secrets mounted to the host, and other malicious things.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Complexity:** **easy** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** EKS_INVALID_HOSTPATH_MOUNT_READONLY_VALUE

---

## This rule will fail

If a `hostPath` volume is mounted without being set as read-only:

```yaml
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: mount-this
      hostPath: 
        path: /cache
        type: Directory
  containers:
  - volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /cache
      name: mount-this
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Ensure hostPath volume mounts are read-only [1 occurrence]
üí° Invalid key `readOnly` - set to 'true' to prevent potential attacks on the host filesystem
```

---

## How to fix this failure

```yaml
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: mount-this
      hostPath: 
        path: /cache
        type: Directory
  containers:
  - volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /cache
      name: mount-this
      readOnly: true
```
