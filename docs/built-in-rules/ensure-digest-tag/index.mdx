title: ☑️ Ensure each container image has a digest tag
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-digest-tag
---

import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

To make sure the container always uses the same version of the image, you can specify its [digest](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/#pull-an-image-by-digest-immutable-identifier). The digest uniquely identifies a specific version of the image, so it will never be updated by Kubernetes unless you change the digest value.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Complexity:** **medium** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_MISSING_IMAGE_VALUE_DIGEST

---

## This rule will fail

If a container doesn't have a digest image tag

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Ensure each container image has a digest tag [1 occurrence]
💡 Incorrect value for key `image` - add a digest tag (beginning with `@sha256:`) to represent an immutable version of the image
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Each container image should have an image ID (aka image SHA)

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx@sha256:0a564e80a3156f2cc825d1720f303d59bd521da19bcbd01316870e1313ecbd23
```
