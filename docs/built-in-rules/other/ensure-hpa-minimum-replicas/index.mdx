title: ☑️ Ensure HPA has minimum replicas configured
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-hpa-minimum-replicas
displayed_sidebar: docs2
---

When auto-scaling resource utilization is triggered with HPA (_HorizontalPodAutoscaler_), a range of acceptable values must be set to prevent unintended scaling down scenarios.

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **HorizontalPodAutoscaler

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** HPA_MISSING_MINREPLICAS_KEY

---

## This rule will fail

If an HPA doesn't have minimum replicas configured

```yaml
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
spec:
  maxReplicas: 10
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Ensure HPA has minimum replicas configured [1 occurrence]
💡 Missing property object `minReplicas` - the value should be within the accepted boundaries recommended by the organization
```

---

## How to fix this failure

```yaml
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
spec:
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
```
