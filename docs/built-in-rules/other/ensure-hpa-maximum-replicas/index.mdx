title: ☑️ Ensure HPA has maximum replicas configured

It's preferable to manage services and applications in clusters using higher-level resources such as Deployments, StatefulSets and DaemonSets instead of raw Pod resources. These constructs include standard default features which, in most scenarios, are necessary to configure and maintain a stable cluster.

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Pod

**Enabled by default?** False

**Policy as code identifier:** K8S_INCORRECT_KIND_VALUE_POD

---

## This rule will fail

If `kind` type is set as _Pod_

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Pod
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```none
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Prevent deploying naked pods [1 occurrence]
💡 Incorrect value for key `kind` - raw pod won't be rescheduled in the event of a node failure
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Deploy pods using higher-level resources

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
```
