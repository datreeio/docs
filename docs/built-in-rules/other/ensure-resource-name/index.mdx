title: ☑️ Ensure resource has a configured name
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-resource-name
---

`metadata.name` OR `metadata.generateName` is a mandatory property in every K8s resource type. 
Validation that this property exists occurs is on the k8s server-side only, and is not enforced as part of the official schema. 
Therefore, a YAML without this property will pass k8s schema validation, but will fail when pushed into a cluster (i.e. when running kubectl apply/create).

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of **`kind`**):** All

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** RESOURCE_MISSING_NAME

---

## This rule will fail

If a resource does not contain one of the propreties `name` or `generateName`

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  namespace: "myGreatNamespace"
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Ensure resource has a configured name [1 occurrence]
💡 Missing key `name` or `generateName` - one of them must be set to apply resource to a cluster
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Set either `name` or `generateName` and give it a value

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: "myGreatIngress"
  namespace: "myGreatNamespace"
```
