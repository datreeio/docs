title: ‚òëÔ∏è Prevent Ingress from forwarding all traffic to a single container
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-ingress-forwarding-traffic-to-single-container
---

Misconfiguring the ingress host can unintended forward all traffic to a single pod instead of leveraging the load balancing capabilities. By verifying that ingress traffic is targeted by multiple pods, you will achieve higher application availability because you won't be dependent upon a single pod to serve all ingress traffic.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Ingress

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** INGRESS_INCORRECT_HOST_VALUE_PERMISSIVE

---

## This rule will fail

If only a wildcard character (\`\*\`) is used to describe the targeted `host`

```yaml
kind: Ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: "*"
      http:
        - path: /foo
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Prevent Ingress from forwarding all traffic to a single container [1 occurrence]
üí° Incorrect value for key `host` - specify host instead of using a wildcard character (`*`)
```

---

## How to fix this failure

```yaml
kind: Ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: "*.example.com"
      http:
        - path: /foo
```
