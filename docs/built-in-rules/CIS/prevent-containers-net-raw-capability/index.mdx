title: ‚òëÔ∏è Prevent the admission of containers with the NET_RAW capability
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-containers-net-raw-capability
---

import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the Container Runtime. By default this can include potentially dangerous capabilities. With Docker as the container runtime the `NET_RAW` capability is enabled which may be misused by malicious containers.  
Ideally, all containers should drop this capability.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**):** Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Complexity:** **medium** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** CIS_MISSING_VALUE_DROP_NET_RAW

---

## This rule will fail

If the `NET_RAW` capability is not dropped by the container:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-pod
    image: gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Prevent the admission of containers with the NET_RAW capability [1 occurrence]
üí° Invalid value for key `drop` - prohibit the potentially dangerous NET_RAW capability
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Drop the `NET_RAW` capability from the container:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-pod
    image: gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        drop: ["NET_RAW"]
```
