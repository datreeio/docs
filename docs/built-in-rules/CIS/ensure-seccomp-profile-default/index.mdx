title: ‚òëÔ∏è Ensure seccomp profile is set to docker/default or runtime/default
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-seccomp-profile-default

import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

Seccomp (secure computing mode) is used to restrict the set of system calls applications can make, allowing cluster administrators greater control over the security of workloads running in the cluster.  
Kubernetes disables seccomp profiles by default for historical reasons. You should enable it to ensure that the workloads have restricted actions available within the container.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**):** Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Complexity:** **medium** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** CIS_INVALID_VALUE_SECCOMP_PROFILE

---

## This rule will fail

If seccomp is disabled or not set to an valid value:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Ensure seccomp profile is set to docker/default or runtime/default [1 occurrence]
üí° Invalid value for key `seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod` - set to docker/default or runtime/default to ensure restricted privileges
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Pods should have a seccomp profile set to `docker/default` or `runtime/default`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  annotations:
    seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod: docker/default
```
