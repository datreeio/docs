import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

The ability to create pods in a namespace can provide a number of opportunities for privilege escalation, such as assigning privileged service accounts to these pods or mounting hostPaths with access to sensitive data.  
As such, access to create new pods should be restricted to the smallest possible group of users.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**):** Role / ClusterRole

**Complexity:** **medium** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** CIS_INVALID_VALUE_CREATE_POD

---

## This rule will fail

If a Role or ClusterRole provides `create` access to pods:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
rules:
  - resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["create"]
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Prevent access to create pods [1 occurrence]
üí° Invalid value for key `resources`/`verbs` - prohibit creating pods to prevent undesired privilege escalation
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Do not allow `create` access to pods:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
rules:
  - resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```
