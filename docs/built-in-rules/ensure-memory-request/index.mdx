title: ‚òëÔ∏è Ensure each container has a configured memory request
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-memory-request
---

import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

Memory requests allow you to use memory resources efficiently and allow you to allocate a guaranteed minimum of computing resources for the pods running in your cluster.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Complexity:** **hard** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_MISSING_MEMORY_REQUEST_KEY

## This rule will fail

If a container doesn't have a memory request configured

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Ensure each container has a configured memory request [1 occurrence]
üí° Missing property object `requests.memory` - value should be within the accepted boundaries recommended by the organization
```

---

## How to fix this failure

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:1.19.8
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: "64Mi"
```
