title: ‚òëÔ∏è Ensure CronJob has a configured deadline
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-cronjob-deadline
---

import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

When the CronJob controller counts more than **100** missed schedules, the cron job is no longer scheduled. Missed CronJobs are considered failures.

By default, the CronJob controller counts how many missed schedules happen for a cron job since `status.lastScheduleTime`¬†until now. When `startingDeadlineSeconds` is set, the CronJob controller counts how many missed jobs occurred between the value of¬†`startingDeadlineSeconds`¬†until now.

Setting a deadline can reduce the number of missed schedules needed to mark a CronJob as a failure while increasing the CronJob reliability.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **CronJob

**Complexity:** **medium** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** CRONJOB_MISSING_STARTINGDEADLINESECOND_KEY

## This rule will fail

If a CronJob doesn't have a `startingDeadlineSeconds` key configured

```yaml
kind: CronJob
spec:
  schedule: "*/1 * * * *"
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Ensure CronJob has a configured deadline [1 occurrence]
üí° Missing property object `startingDeadlineSeconds` - set a time limit for the cron execution to allow killing it if exceeded
```

---

## How to fix this failure

```yaml
kind: CronJob
spec:
  schedule: "*/1 * * * *"
  startingDeadlineSeconds: 100
```
