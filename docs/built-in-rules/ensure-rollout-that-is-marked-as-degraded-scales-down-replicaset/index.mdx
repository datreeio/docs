title: ☑️ Ensure Rollout that is marked as degraded scales down ReplicaSet

import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

Users can set the `progressDeadlineSeconds` key which states the maximum time in seconds in which a Rollout must make progress during an update before it is considered to be failed.

If rollout pods get stuck in an error state (e.g. image pull back off), the rollout degrades after the progress deadline is exceeded but the bad ReplicaSet/Pods aren't scaled down. The pods would keep retrying and eventually the rollout message would read _ProgressDeadlineExceeded: The replicaset <name\> has timed out progressing_.

To abort the rollout, the user should also set `progressDeadlineAbort`.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of kind): **Rollout

**Complexity:** **medium** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** ARGO_ROLLOUT_INCORRECT_PROGRESS_DEADLINE_ABORT_VALUE_FALSE

---

## This rule will fail

If the `progressDeadlineSeconds` key is set, but the `progressDeadlineAbort` key is not set or set to '_false_':

```yaml
kind: Rollout
spec:
  progressDeadlineSeconds: 700
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Ensure Rollout that is marked as degraded scales down ReplicaSet [1 occurrence]
💡 Incorrect value for key `progressDeadlineAbort` - value should be `true` to prevent the rollout pod from retrying indefinitely
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Set the `progressDeadlineAbort` key with value of '_true_':

```yaml
kind: Rollout
spec:
  progressDeadlineSeconds: 700
  progressDeadlineAbort: true
```
