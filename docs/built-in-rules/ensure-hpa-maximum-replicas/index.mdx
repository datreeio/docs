title: ‚òëÔ∏è Ensure HPA has maximum replicas configured
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-hpa-maximum-replicas

import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

When auto-scaling resource utilization is triggered by HPA (_HorizontalPodAutoscaler_), a range of acceptable values must be set to prevent unintended scaling-up scenarios.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Pod

**Complexity:** **medium** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** HPA_MISSING_MAXREPLICAS_KEY

---

## This rule will fail

If an HPA doesn't have maximum replicas configured

```yaml
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
spec:
  minReplicas: 1
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Ensure HPA has maximum replicas configured [1 occurrence]
üí° Missing property object `maxReplicas` - the value should be within the accepted boundaries recommended by the organization
```

---

## How to fix this failure

```yaml
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
spec:
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
```
