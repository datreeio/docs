title: ‚òëÔ∏è Prevent use of removed APIs in Kubernetes v1.27
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-removed-api-127
---

import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

Kubernetes version 1.27 stopped serving several APIs for different resource types.  
When deploying a resource with a removed API version, the Kubernetes engine will reject it.

The following resources are **removed** in version 1.27:

| API version | Resource kind |
|-------------|---------------|
| `storage.k8s.io/v1beta1` | `CSIStorageCapacity` |

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**):** (See table above)

**Complexity:** **easy** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** REMOVED_API_VERSION_1.27

---

## This rule will fail

If one of the removed API versions is used:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: CSIStorageCapacity
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Prevent use of removed APIs in Kubernetes v1.27 [1 occurrence]
üí° Incorrect value for key `apiVersion` - the version of the resource you are trying to use is removed in k8s v1.27
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Use a supported API version instead of the removed one:

| Removed API version | Supported API version |
|-------------|---------------|
| `storage.k8s.io/v1beta1` | `storage.k8s.io/v1` |

**Example**:  

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: CSIStorageCapacity
```
