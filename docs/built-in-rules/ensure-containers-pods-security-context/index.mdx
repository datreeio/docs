import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

A security context defines the operating system security settings (uid, gid, capabilities, SELinux role, etc..) applied to a container, and controls the security parameters that will be assigned to it.  
Well-defined privilege and access control settings will enhance assurance that your pod is running with the properties it requires to function.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**):** Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Complexity:** **medium** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** CIS_MISSING_KEY_SECURITYCONTEXT

## This rule will fail

If a pod or container does not have a security context defined:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Ensure containers and pods have a configured security context [1 occurrence]
üí° Missing key `securityContext` - set to enforce your containers' security and stability
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Define a security context for your pod or container:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: [ "SYS_TIME"]
```
