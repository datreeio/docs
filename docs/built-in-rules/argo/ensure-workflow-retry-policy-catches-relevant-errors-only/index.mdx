title: ☑️ Ensure Workflow retry policy catches relevant errors only
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-workflow-retry-policy-catches-relevant-errors-only
---

`retryStrategy` is an optional field of the Workflow CRD that provides control over how to retry a workflow step. One of its fields is `retryPolicy`, which defines the policy of NodePhase statuses that will be retried (NodePhase is the condition of a node at the current time).

The value of `retryPolicy` can be either: _Always_, _OnError_, or _OnTransientError_. In addition, the user can use the[ **_expression_**](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/retries/#conditional-retries) key to control more of the retries.

What’s the catch?

- **retryPolicy=Always is too much.** The user only wants to retry on system-level errors (eg, the node dying or being preempted), but not on errors occurring in user-level code since these failures indicate a bug. In addition, this option is more suitable for long-running containers than workflows which are jobs.

- **retryPolicy=OnError doesn't handle preemptions**: retryPolicy=OnError handles _some_ system-level errors like the node disappearing or the pod being deleted. However, during graceful Pod termination, the kubelet assigns a Failed status and a Shutdown reason to the terminated Pods. As a result, node preemptions result in node status "Failure", not "Error" so preemptions aren't retried.

- **retryPolicy=OnError doesn't handle transient errors:** Classify preemption failure message as a transient error is allowed however, this requires retryPolicy=OnTransientError. (see also, TRANSIENT_ERROR_PATTERN).

It is recommended to use Always, along with this expression that filters out unnecessary errors:

> lastRetry.status == "Error" or (lastRetry.status == "Failed" and asInt(lastRetry.exitCode) not in [0])

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of kind): **Workflow

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** ARGO_WORKFLOW_ENSURE_RETRY_ON_BOTH_ERROR_AND_TRANSIENT_ERROR

## This rule will fail

If the retryPolicy key is set with a value of Always, but the aforementioned expression is not set:

```yaml
kind: Workflow
spec:
  templates:
  - retryStrategy:
      retryPolicy: "Always"
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Ensure Workflow retry policy catches relevant errors only [1 occurrence]
💡 Incorrect value for key `retryPolicy` - the expression should include retry on steps that failed either on transient or Argo controller errors
```

---

## How to fix this failure

When using a `retryPolicy` of `Always`, set the `expression` key with the following value:

```yaml
kind: Workflow
spec:
  templates:
  - retryStrategy:
      retryPolicy: "Always"
        expression: 'lastRetry.status == "Error" or (lastRetry.status == "Failed" and asInt(lastRetry.exitCode) not in [0])'
```
