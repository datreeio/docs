title: ☑️ Prevent Workflow pods from using the default service account
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-workflow-pods-from-using-the-default-service-account
displayed_sidebar: docs2
---

All pods in a Workflow run with the service account. The service account can be specified in `workflow.spec.serviceAccountName`, or if omitted, the default service account of the workflow's namespace is used.  This provides the workflow(i.e the pod) the ability to interact with the Kubernetes API server and because this behavior is enabled by default, it creates a great way for attackers with access to a single container, to abuse Kubernetes with the AutomountServiceAccountToken.

If by any chance, the user disabled the option for AutomountServiceAccountToken the default service account that Argo is using does not have any permissions, and the workflow will fail.

We recommend that users create their own user-managed service accounts and grant the appropriate roles to each service account.

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of kind): **Workflow / WorkflowTemplate

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** ARGO_WORKFLOW_INCORRECT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME_VALUE_DEFAULT

---

## This rule will fail

If `serviceAccountName` is set to '_default_' or not set at all:

```yaml
kind: WorkflowTemplate
spec:
  entrypoint: entry-point
  serviceAccountName: default
```

```yaml
kind: WorkflowTemplate
spec:
  entrypoint: entry-point
  serviceAccountName: default
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```none
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Prevent Workflow pods from using the default service account [1 occurrence]
💡 Incorrect value for key `serviceAccountName` - when set to `default` container is exposed to possible attacks
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Set the `serviceAccountName` key and give it a value:

```yaml
kind: Workflow
spec:
  serviceAccountName: mySrvAcc
```
