title: ☑️ Prevent Workflow from having an empty retry strategy
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-workflow-from-having-an-empty-retry-strategy
---

The user can specify a `retryStrategy` that will dictate how failed or errored steps are retried in a workflow. Providing an empty `retryStrategy` (i.e. retryStrategy: {}) will cause a container to retry until completion and eventually cause OOM issues.

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of kind): **Workflow

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** ARGO_WORKFLOW_INCORRECT_RETRY_STRATEGY_VALUE_EMPTY

---

## This rule will fail

If the `retryStrategy` key is set with an empty value {}:

```yaml
kind: Workflow
spec:
  templates:
  - retryStrategy: {}
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Prevent Workflow from having an empty retry strategy [1 occurrence]
💡 Incorrect value for key `retryStrategy` - empty value (`{}`) can cause failed/errored steps to keep retrying, which can result in OOM issues
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Set the `retryStrategy` key with a non-empty value or don't set it at all:

```yaml
kind: Workflow
spec:
  templates:
  - retryStrategy:
     limit: 10
```
