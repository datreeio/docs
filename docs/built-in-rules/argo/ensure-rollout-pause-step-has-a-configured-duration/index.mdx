title: ☑️ Ensure Rollout pause step has a configured duration
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-rollout-pause-step-has-a-configured-duration
---

Users can define a list of steps the controller uses to manipulate the ReplicaSets during the rollout. Each step can have one of two fields.

The `setWeight` field dictates the percentage of traffic that should be sent to the canary, and the `pause` struct instructs the rollout to pause.

When the controller reaches a pause step for a rollout, it will set adds a PauseCondition struct to the `.status.PauseConditions` field. If the duration field within the pause struct is set, the rollout will not progress to the next step until it has waited for the value of the `duration` field. **Otherwise, the rollout will wait indefinitely** until that Pause condition is removed.

By using the `setWeight` and the `pause` fields, a user can declaratively describe how they want to progress to the new version.

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of kind): **Rollout

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** ARGO_ROLLOUT_MISSING_PAUSE_DURATION

## This rule will fail

If the `duration` key is not set:

```yaml
kind: Rollout
spec:
  strategy:
    canary:
      steps:
      - pause: {}
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```none
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Ensure Rollout pause step has a configured duration [1 occurrence]
💡 Missing the key `duration` - prevent the rollout from waiting indefinitely for the pause condition
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Set the `duration` key and give it a value:

```yaml
kind: Rollout
spec:
  strategy:
    canary:
      steps:
      - pause:
         duration: 1h # 1 hour
```
