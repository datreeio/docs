title: ☑️ Ensure Application and AppProject are part of the argocd namespace
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-application-and-appproject-are-part-of-the-argocd-namespace
---

ArgoCD is installed in a specific namespace (by default it's '_argocd_'). All of its resources, including Application and AppProject instances, have to be installed in that namespace.

NOTE: This rule will enforce using the 'argocd' namespace. If you wish to use another namespace and still want to enforce this rule, disable this rule in your dashboard and create a custom rule for your namespace.

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of kind):** AppProject / Application

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** ARGO_APP_PROJECT_INCORRECT_NAMESPACE_VALUE

---

## This rule will fail

If the `namespace` key is not set, or set to a value other than '_argocd_':

```yaml
kind: Application
metadata:
  namespace: myNamespace
```

```yaml
kind: AppProject
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: argocd-cm
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Ensure Application and AppProject are part of the argocd namespace [1 occurrence]
💡 Incorrect value for property `namespace` - Application and AppProject have to be installed on the argocd namespace
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Set the `namespace` key with a value of '_argocd_':

```yaml
kind: Application
metadata:
  namespace: argocd
```
