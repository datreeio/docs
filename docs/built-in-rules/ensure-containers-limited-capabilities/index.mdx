title: ☑️ Ensure containers have limited capabilities
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-containers-limited-capabilities

import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

[Linux kernel capabilities](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) are a set of privileges. Docker, by default, runs with only a subset of capabilities. You can change it and drop some capabilities (using `--cap-drop`) to harden your docker containers, or add some capabilities (using `--cap-add`) if needed. 

:::caution Note
Remember not to run containers with the `--privileged` flag - this will add ALL Linux kernel capabilities to the container.
:::

**The following capabilities are considered safe, any others should be avoided:**
- AUDIT_WRITE
- CHOWN
- DAC_OVERRIDE
- FOWNER
- FSETID
- KILL
- MKNOD
- NET_BIND_SERVICE
- SETFCAP
- SETGID
- SETPCAP
- SETUID
- SYS_CHROOT

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Complexity:** **medium** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** EKS_INVALID_CAPABILITIES_EKS

---

## This rule will fail

If a container has an unsafe capability:

```yaml
securityContext:
  capabilities:
    add:
      - SYS_ADMIN
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Ensure containers have limited capabilities [1 occurrence]
💡 Incorrect value for key `add` - refrain from using insecure capabilities to prevent access to sensitive components
```

---

## How to fix this failure

```yaml
securityContext:
  capabilities:
    add:
      - AUDIT_WRITE
```
