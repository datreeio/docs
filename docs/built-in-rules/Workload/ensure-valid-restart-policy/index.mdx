title: ‚òëÔ∏è Ensure deployment-like resource is using a valid restart policy
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-valid-restart-policy
---

From the Kubernetes docs:

_"Only a `.spec.template.spec.restartPolicy` equal to Always is allowed, which is the default if not specified."_

Therefore, `restartPolicy` values like _OnFailure_ or _Never_ will be invalid and will not be applied as the user expect them to.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**):** Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / ReplicaSet / ReplicationController

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** WORKLOAD_INCORRECT_RESTARTPOLICY_VALUE_ALWAYS

---

## This rule will fail

If `restartPolicy` is set with any value other than _Always_

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Ensure deployment-like resource is using a valid restart policy [1 occurrence]
üí° Incorrect value for key `restartPolicy` - any other value than `Always` is not supported by this resource
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Set `restartPolicy` to _Always_ or don't include the `restartPolicy` key at all

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Always
```
