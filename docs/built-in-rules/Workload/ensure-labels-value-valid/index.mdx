title: ☑️ Ensure workload has valid label values
slug: /built-in-rules/workload/ensure-labels-value-valid
---

Labels are nothing more than custom key-value pairs that are attached to objects and are used to describe and manage different Kubernetes resources. If the labels do not follow Kubernetes label syntax requirements (see links below), they will not be applied properly.

:::info

## FYI

Labels' keys and values are case-sensitive!
:::

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** WORKLOAD_INVALID_LABELS_VALUE

---

## This rule will fail

If one of the keys under `labels` contains an invalid value

```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    on-call: yoda@datree.io
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```none
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Ensure workload has valid label values [1 occurrence]
💡 Incorrect value for key(s) under `labels` - the vales syntax is not valid so the Kubernetes engine will not accept it
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Use valid values only (see links below for valid syntax)

```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    on-call: yoda-at-datree.io
```
