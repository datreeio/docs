title: ‚òëÔ∏è Ensure workload has valid label values
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-labels-value-valid
---

Labels are nothing more than custom key-value pairs that are attached to objects and are used to describe and manage different Kubernetes resources.¬†If the labels do not follow Kubernetes label syntax requirements (see links below), they will not be applied properly.

:::info

Labels' keys and values are case-sensitive!
:::

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** WORKLOAD_INVALID_LABELS_VALUE

---

## This rule will fail

If one of the keys under `labels` contains an invalid value

```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    on-call: yoda@datree.io
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Ensure workload has valid label values [1 occurrence]
üí° Incorrect value for key(s) under `labels` - the vales syntax is not valid so the Kubernetes engine will not accept it
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Use valid values only (see links below for valid syntax)

```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    on-call: yoda-at-datree.io
```
