title: ☑️ Ensure Deployment has more than one replica configured
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-minimum-two-replicas
---

When you run two or more replicas per service, you are increasing the availability of the containerized service because you are not relying on a single pod to do all of the work. Furthermore, scaling horizontally by adding pods allows your service to scale and handle larger loads.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** DEPLOYMENT_INCORRECT_REPLICAS_VALUE

---

## This rule will fail

If the number of `replicas` is set to 1

```yaml
kind: Deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Ensure Deployment has more than one replica configured [1 occurrence]
💡 Incorrect value for key `replicas` - running 2 or more replicas will increase the availability of the service
```

## How to fix this failure

Set numbers of `replicas` to be greater than 1

```yaml
kind: Deployment
spec:
