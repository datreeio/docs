title: ☑️ Ensure workload has a configured `owner` label
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-owner-label
displayed_sidebar: docs2
---

An `owner` label is great not only for financial ownership but also useful for operational ownership. Consider adding an `owner` label to your workload with the name, email alias or Slack channel of the team responsible for the service. This will make it easier to alert the relevant team or team member when necessary.

## FYI

Labels' keys and values are case-sensitive!

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job
