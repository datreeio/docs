import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

The Kubernetes API stores secrets, which may be service account tokens for the Kubernetes API or credentials used by workloads in the cluster. Access to these secrets should be restricted to the smallest possible group of users to reduce the risk of privilege escalation.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**):** Role / ClusterRole

**Complexity:** **medium** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** CIS_INVALID_VERB_SECRETS

---

## This rule will fail

If `get`, `list`, or `watch` permissions are given to the `secrets` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
rules:
  - resources: ["secrets"]
    verbs: ["get"]
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Prevent access to secrets [1 occurrence]
üí° Incorrect value/s for key `verbs` - access to secrets should be restricted to the smallest possible group of users to reduce the risk of privilege escalation
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Remove `get`, `list`, or `watch` permissions from the `secrets` resource.
