Kubernetes objects may need to use secret data in their manifests such as passwords/tokens/etc. Providing such sensitive data in plain-text is risky and highly unrecommended, as it can be stolen and used maliciously.  
Different tools have different secrets, each with its own convention and format.

The [gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) project aggregates such tools and stays up-to-date with their secret data format.
