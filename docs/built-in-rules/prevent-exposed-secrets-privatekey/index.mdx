## This rule will fail

If a **private key** is present anywhere in the config:

```yaml
KEY: -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----MIIBVAIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCAT4wggE6AgEAAkEAqPfgaTEWEP3S9w0t-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Prevent exposed private keys in objects [1 occurrence]
💡 Secret data found in config - keep your sensitive data elsewhere to prevent it from being stolen 
```
