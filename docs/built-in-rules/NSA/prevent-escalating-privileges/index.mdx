title: ☑️ Prevent containers from escalating privileges
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-escalating-privileges
displayed_sidebar: docs2
---

Privileged escalation allows a process to change the security context under which its running. In their default state, containers allow privilege escalation*. *Attackers may use this default behavior to manipulate the application or process and to gain more permissions than they should have.

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_MISSING_KEY_ALLOWPRIVILEGEESCALATION

---

## This rule will fail

If the key `allowPrivilegeEscalation` is not explicitly set to *false*:

```yaml
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myContainer
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Prevent containers from escalating privileges [1 occurrence]
💡 Missing key `allowPrivilegeEscalation` - set to false to prevent attackers from exploiting escalated container privileges
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Set the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` key to *false*:

```yaml
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myContainer
        securityContext:
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```
