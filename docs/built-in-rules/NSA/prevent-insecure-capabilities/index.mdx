title: ☑️ Prevent containers from having insecure capabilities
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-insecure-capabilities
---

Capabilities permit certain named root actions without giving full root access. They are a more fine-grained permissions model, and all capabilities should be dropped from a pod, with only those required added back. Giving containers unnecessary capabilities may compromise them and allow attackers access to sensitive components.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_INVALID_CAPABILITIES_VALUE

---

## This rule will fail

If one or more of the following insecure capabilities are set:

- SETPCAP
- NET_ADMIN
- NET_RAW
- SYS_MODULE
- SYS_RAWIO
- SYS_PTRACE
- SYS_ADMIN
- SYS_BOOT
- MAC_OVERRIDE
- MAC_ADMIN
- PERFMON
- ALL
- BPF

```yaml
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
    - securityContext:
        capabilities:
          add: ["SYS_ADMIN", "PERFMON"]
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Prevent containers from having insecure capabilities [1 occurrence]
💡 Incorrect value for key `add` - refrain from using insecure capabilities to prevent access to sensitive components
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Refrain from setting any unnecessary insecure capabilities.

```yaml
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
    - securityContext:
        capabilities:
          add: ["SYS_TIME"]
```
