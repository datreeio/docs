title: ‚òëÔ∏è Ensure each container has a read-only root filesystem
slug: /built-in-rules/ensure-read-only-filesystem
---

import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

An immutable root filesystem prevents applications from writing to their local disk. This is desirable in the event of an intrusion as the attacker will not be able to tamper with the filesystem or write foreign executables to disk.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Complexity:** **easy** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_READONLYROOTFILESYSTEM_VALUE

---

## This rule will fail

If the key `readOnlyRootFilesystem` is not defined or set to _false_.

```yaml
kind: Deployment
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myDeployment
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Ensure each container has a read-only root filesystem [1 occurrence]
üí° Incorrect value for key `readOnlyRootFilesystem` - set to 'true' to protect filesystem from potential attacks
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Set the `readOnlyRootFilesystem` key with a value of _true_ either at **pod** level or **container** level:

```yaml
kind: Pod
spec:
  securityContext:
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

```yaml
kind: Deployment
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myContainer
      securityContext:
        readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```
