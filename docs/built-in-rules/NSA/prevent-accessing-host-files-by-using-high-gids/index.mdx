title: ‚òëÔ∏è Prevent containers from accessing host files by using high GIDs
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-accessing-host-files-by-using-high-gids
---

It's recommended for containers to run under UIDs that are not used on the host system. With a high UID number, a container is blocked from accessing host-based files even if it manages to gain access to a host's file system.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**):** Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_RUNASGROUP_VALUE_LOWGID

---

## This rule will fail

If `runAsGroup` is set to a value lower than _1000_:

```yaml
kind: Pod
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsGroup: 300
```

```yaml
kind: Deployment
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myContainer
      securityContext:
        runAsGroup: 300
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Prevent containers from accessing host files by using high GIDs [1 occurrence]
üí° Invalid value for key `runAsGroup` - must be greater than 999 to ensure container is running with non-root group membership
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Set runAsGroup to a value higher than _999_:

```yaml
kind: Pod
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsGroup: 4000
```

```yaml
kind: Deployment
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myContainer
      securityContext:
        runAsGroup: 4000
```
