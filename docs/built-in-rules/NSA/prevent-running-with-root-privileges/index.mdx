title: ‚òëÔ∏è Prevent container from running with root privileges
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-running-with-root-privileges
---

NSA encourages developers to build container applications to execute as a non-root user. Having non-root execution integrated at build time provides better assurance that applications will function correctly without root privileges. Therefore, it's recommended for containers to run with the least privileges possible.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**):** Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_RUNASNONROOT_VALUE

---

## This rule will fail

If `runAsNonRoot` is not set or set to _false_:

```yaml
kind: Pod
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsGroup: 5000
```

```yaml
kind: Deployment
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myContainer
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: false
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Prevent container from running with root privileges [1 occurrence]
üí° Invalid value for key `runAsNonRoot` - must be set to `true` to prevent unnecessary privileges
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Set `runAsNonRoot` to `true`:

```yaml
kind: Pod
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
```

```yaml
kind: Deployment
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myContainer
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
```
