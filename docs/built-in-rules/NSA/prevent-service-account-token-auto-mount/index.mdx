title: ☑️ Prevent service account token auto-mounting on pods
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-service-account-token-auto-mount
displayed_sidebar: docs2
---

By default, Kubernetes automatically provisions a service account when creating a Pod and mounts the account’s secret token within the Pod at runtime. Many containerized applications do not require direct access to the service account.
Therefore, it is recommended to disable the secret token being mounted.

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of **`kind`**):** ServiceAccount / Pod

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** SRVACC_INCORRECT_AUTOMOUNTSERVICEACCOUNTTOKEN_VALUE

---

## This rule will fail

If `automountServiceAccountToken` is not set or set to *true*:

```yaml
kind: ServiceAccount
automountServiceAccountToken: true
```

```yaml
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myContainer
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Prevent service account token auto-mounting on pods [1 occurrence]
💡 Invalid value for key `automountServiceAccountToken` - must be set to `false` to prevent granting unnecessary access to the service account
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Set `automountServiceAccountToken` to *false* either at the `ServiceAccount` level or at the individual `Pod` level (`Pod` level takes precedence):

```yaml
kind: ServiceAccount
automountServiceAccountToken: false
```

```yaml
kind: Pod
spec:
  automountServiceAccountToken: false
  containers:
    - name: myContainer
```
