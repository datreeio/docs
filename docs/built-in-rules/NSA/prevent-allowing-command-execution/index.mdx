slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-allowing-command-execution
---

Kubectl is a command-line tool for managing Kubernetes clusters. 'kubectl exec' allows a user to execute a command in a container. Attackers with permissions could run 'kubectl exec' to execute malicious code and compromise resources within a cluster.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**):** Role / ClusterRole

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_RESOURCES_VERBS_VALUE

---

## This rule will fail

If the `pods/exec` resource and/or the `create` verb are used:

```yaml
kind: Role
rules:
  - resources: ["pods/exec"]
```

```yaml
kind: Role
rules:
  - verbs: ["create"]
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Prevent containers from allowing command execution[1 occurrence]
üí° Incorrect value for key `resources` and/or `verbs` - allowing containers to run the exec command can be exploited by attackers
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Refrain from setting these privilieges in your `Role` and `ClusterRole` resources.

```yaml
kind: Role
rules:
  - verbs: ["get"]
```
