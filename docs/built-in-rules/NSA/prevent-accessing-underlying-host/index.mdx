title: ☑️ Prevent containers from accessing the underlying host
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-accessing-underlying-host
---

Kubernetes pods can use host bind mounts (i.e. directories and volumes mounted on the container host) in containers. Using a hostPath mount can enable attackers to break from the container and gain access to the underlying host. Therefore, it's not recommended to use bind mounts for application pods.

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_KEY_HOSTPATH

---

## This rule will fail

If the key `hostPath` is used:

```yaml
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: myVolume
      hostPath:
        path: /data
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Prevent containers from accessing the underlying host [1 occurrence]
💡 Invalid key `hostPath` - refrain from using this mount to prevent an attack on the underlying host
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Refrain from using the `hostPath` mount

```yaml
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: myVolume
```
