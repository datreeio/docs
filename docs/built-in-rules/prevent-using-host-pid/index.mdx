title: ‚òëÔ∏è Prevent containers from sharing the host's PID namespace
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-using-host-pid
---

import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

When a container is allowed to share its host's PID namespace, it can see and in some cases even kill processes running on the host outside of the container. This violates the principle of least privilege - you will likely never need a pod to access other processes outside of its own namespace.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **Deployment / Pod / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet / CronJob / Job

**Complexity:** **easy** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** CONTAINERS_INCORRECT_HOSTPID_VALUE_TRUE

---

## This rule will fail

If `hostPID` is set to _true_

```yaml
spec:
  hostPID: true
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Prevent containers from sharing the host's PID namespace [1 occurrence]
üí° Incorrect value for key `hostPID` - running on the host's PID namespace enables access to sensitive information from processes running outside the container
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Set the `hostPID` to _false_ or remove it completely

```yaml
spec:
  hostPID: false
```
