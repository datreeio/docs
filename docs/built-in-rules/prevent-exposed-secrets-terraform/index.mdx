**Policy as code identifier:** ALL_EXPOSED_SECRET_TERRAFORM

## This rule will fail

If a Terraform **API token** is present anywhere in the config:

```yaml
API_TOKEN: qoy9xh5sm50tue.atlasv1.b4udif2t66iyk_1cjpvpktac9j4awk9wwrh=pc_3cxc4wl1txvdwfyryyo_d
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Prevent exposed Terraform secrets in objects [1 occurrence]
💡 Secret data found in config - keep your sensitive data elsewhere to prevent it from being stolen 
```
