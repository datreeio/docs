title: ☑️ Prevent deprecated APIs in Kubernetes v1.17
slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-deprecated-k8s-api-117
displayed_sidebar: docs2
---

The v1.17 release stopped serving some API versions for different resource types. When a user deploys a resource with a deprecated API version, the Kubernetes engine rejects it.

:::caution

Kubernetes v1.17 is no longer (officially) supported since 30 January 2021, So if you are still running this version, consider upgrading it as soon as possible.

:::

**Targeted resources by this rule (types of **`kind`**):** NetworkPolicy / Deployment / DaemonSet / StatefulSet

**Enabled by default?** True

**Policy as code identifier:** K8S_DEPRECATED_APIVERSION_1.17

---

## This rule will fail

If one of the following API versions is used

- _kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta1_
- _rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1alpha1_
- _rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1_

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```none
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Prevent deprecated APIs in Kubernetes v1.17 [1 occurrence]
💡 Incorrect value for key `apiVersion` - the version you are trying to use is not supported by the Kubernetes cluster version (>=1.17)
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Use *v1* **instead of the deprecated version

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
```
