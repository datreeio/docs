slug: /built-in-rules/prevent-deprecated-k8s-api-116

import Complexity from "@site/src/components/complexity/ComplexityWindow.js";

The¬†v1.16¬†release stopped serving some API versions for different resource types. When a user deploys a resource with a deprecated API version, the Kubernetes engine rejects it.

:::caution

Kubernetes v1.16 is no longer (officially) supported since 2 September 2020, So if you are still running this version, consider upgrading it as soon as possible.

:::

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**):** NetworkPolicy / Deployment / DaemonSet / StatefulSet

**Complexity:** **easy** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** K8S_DEPRECATED_APIVERSION_1.16

---

## This rule will fail

If one of the following API versions is used:

- _extensions/v1beta1_
- _apps/v1beta1_
- _apps/v1beta2_

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1beta2
kind: Deployment
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
‚ùå Prevent deprecated APIs in Kubernetes v1.16 [1 occurrence]
üí° Incorrect value for key `apiVersion` - the version you are trying to use is not supported by the Kubernetes cluster version (>=1.16)
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Use _apps/v1_ instead of the deprecated version

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
```
