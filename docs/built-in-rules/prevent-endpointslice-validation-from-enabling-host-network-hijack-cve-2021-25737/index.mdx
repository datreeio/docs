A vulnerability has been found in Kubernetes *kube-apiserver *in which an authorized user could redirect pod traffic to private networks on a node ([NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-25737) severity of this issue: **Low**).

By exploiting the vulnerability, attackers can hijack your cluster’s network traffic, potentially leading to sensitive data leaks.

**Targeted objects by this rule (types of **`kind`**): **EndpointSlice

**Complexity:** **hard** (<Complexity/>)

**Policy as code identifier:** ENDPOINTSLICE_CVE2021_25373_INCORRECT_ADDRESSES_VALUE

---

## This rule will fail

If an EndpointSlice is created or modified with `endpoints.addresses` in the **127.0.0.0/8** and **169.254.0.0/16** internal ranges.

```yaml
kind: EndpointSlice
endpoints:
  - addresses:
      - "169.254.23.4"
```

### Rule output in the CLI

```terminal
$ datree test *.yaml

>> File: failExample.yaml
❌ Prevent EndpointSlice validation from enabling host network hijack (CVE-2021-25737) [1 occurrence]
💡 Incorrect value\s for key 'addresses' - address is within vulnerable ranges (127.0.0.0/8 and 169.254.0.0/16)
```

---

## How to fix this failure

Use endpoint addresses that are not in the vulnerable ranges (**127.0.0.0/8** and **169.254.0.0/16**).

```yaml
kind: EndpointSlice
endpoints:
  - addresses:
      - "172.23.47.4"
```
