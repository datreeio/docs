Datree supports writing custom rules in the [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/#what-is-rego) language, by utilizing a custom JSON Schema keyword.

## Required properties

In addition to the basic [required format](/custom-rules/custom-rules-overview#rule-format), a Rego custom rule has the following requirements:

- The `schema` property **must** have a property named `regoDefinition`.
- The `regoDefinition` property **must** have a property named `code` that contains the Rego logic of the rule.
  - The `code` property **must** be a _string_ that contains a `violation` function definition.
  - The `violation` function **must** return a _boolean_ value.
- The `regoDefinition` property **may** have a property named `libs`, which is an array of library functions that will be available to the Rego package.

:::tip Online Rego validation
Ensure the validity of your rules and test them against your resources using the [Rego playground](https://play.openpolicyagent.org/).

#### Example:

The following schema requires the tested `Deployment` resource to have a `billing` label:

```yaml
schema:
  regoDefinition:
    libs:
      - |
        package lib.helpers
        check_if_missing(missing) = isMissing {
                    isMissing := count(missing) > 0
                  }
    code: |
      package requiredlabels
      import data.lib.helpers

      violation[labelIsMissing] {
      input.kind == "Deployment"
      provided := {label | input.metadata.labels[label]}
      required := {"billing"}
      missing := required - provided
      labelIsMissing := helpers.check_if_missing(missing)
      }
```

---

### Constraints

In the above example, the constraint `input.kind == "Deployment"` is a part of the Rego logic.  
You can also write such a constraint in JSON schema and write the rest of the logic in Rego:

```yaml
schema:
  # Constraint - enforce rule only on `Deployment` resources
  if:
    properties:
      kind:
        type: string
        enum:
          - Deployment
  then:
    regoDefinition:
      libs:
        - |
          package lib.helpers
          make_message(isMissing) = msg {
                      msg := sprintf("you must provide labels: %v", [isMissing])
                    }
      code: |
        package examplePackage
        import data.lib.helpers

        violation[aBool] {
        provided := {label | input.metadata.labels[label]}
        required := {"billing"}
        missing := required - provided
        aBool := count(missing) > 0
        }
```
