You can write any custom rule you wish, and then run them against your Kubernetes configurations to check for rule violations. The custom rule engine is based on JSON Schema.

Get started with custom rules by reading the following resources:

- [Understanding custom rules](/custom-rules/custom-rules-overview)

- [Basic examples](/custom-rules/basic-examples)

- [Multiple property paths](/custom-rules/multiple-property-paths)

- [Resource quotas](/custom-rules/resource-quotas)

Also, for easily checking your custom rule logic, We have created an [online YAML Schema validator](https://yamlschemavalidator.datree.io/).
