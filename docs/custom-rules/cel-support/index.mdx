Datree supports writing custom rules in the [CEL](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) language, by utilizing a custom JSON Schema keyword.

:::info Supported version
Writing custom rules in CEL is supported in CLI version [______](https://github.com/datreeio/datree/releases/tag/______) and above.
:::

## Required properties

In addition to the basic [required format](/custom-rules/custom-rules-overview#rule-format), a CEL custom rule has the following requirements:

- The `schema` property **must** have a property named `CELDefinition`, which is an array of object.
- Each object **must** have a property named `expression` that contains the logic of the rule written in CEL.
- Each object **may** have a property named `message`, which specifies what print when the expression is violated.

:::tip Online CEL validation
Ensure the validity of your rules and test them against your resources using an [online CEL playground](https://playcel.undistro.io/).
:::

#### Example:

The following schema requires that resources of kind `ServiceAccount` have the `automountServiceAccountToken` property set to `false`:  

```yaml
schema:
  CELDefinition:
    - expression: "object.kind != 'ServiceAccount' || (has(object.automountServiceAccountToken) && object.automountServiceAccountToken == false)"
      message: "ServiceAccounts must have automountServiceAccountToken set to false" # `message` is optional
```

---

### Constraints

In the above example, the constraint `object.kind != 'ServiceAccount'` is a part of the CEL logic.  
You can also write such a constraint in JSON schema and write the rest of the logic using CEL:

```yaml
schema:
  # Constraint - enforce rule only on `ServiceAccount` resources
  if:
    properties:
      kind:
        type: string
        enum:
          - ServiceAccount
  then:
    CELDefinition:
      - expression: "has(object.automountServiceAccountToken) && object.automountServiceAccountToken == false"
```
