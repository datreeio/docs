Here you will find examples for custom rules and common use-cases when writing policy enforcement logic, using both **JSON schema** and **Rego**.

To see an example of a ready-to-publish custom rules YAML, [skip ahead](/custom-rules/examples#full-custom-rule-examples).

## JSON schema

:::tip
The following examples may include keywords you are not familiar with.  
To learn more about JSON schema and how to use it, see the [official documentation](https://json-schema.org/)
:::

### Ensure a specific key exists

The following schema ensures that the key `metadata.labels.app` exists (regardless of its value):

```yaml
properties:
  metadata:
    properties:
      labels:
        required:
          - app
    required:
      - labels
```

### Set a minimum value for key of a specific kind

The following schema ensures that in a YAML of kind `Deployment`, the key `spec.replicas` has a value of _3_ or higher:

```yaml
if:
  properties:
    kind:
      enum:
        - Deployment
then:
  properties:
    spec:
      properties:
        replicas:
          minimum: 3
```

Note that the key `maximum` is also available.

### Ensure value of a specific key is not one of predefined values

The following schema defines a blacklist of values for the key `metadata.namespace`:

```yaml
properties:
  metadata:
    properties:
      namespace:
        not:
          enum:
            - default
            - misc
            - general
```

### Ensure a specific key is not found in any container

The following schema ensures that the key "badKey" is not defined under any container in the YAML:

```yaml
definitions:
  specContainers:
    properties:
      spec:
        properties:
          containers:
            type: array
            items:
              not:
                required:
                  - badKey
allOf:
  - $ref: "#/definitions/specContainers"
additionalProperties:
  $ref: "#"
```

---

## Rego

### Prevent use of predefined image registry

The following schema ensures that container images are not taken from a predefined registry (`bad.registry.com/`):

```yaml
regoDefinition:
  code: |
    package DenyUnapprovedImageRegistry

    violation[isBadRegistryUsed] {
      container := input_containers[_]
      isBadRegistryUsed := startswith(container.image, "bad.registry.com/")
    }

    input_containers[c] {
      c := input.spec.containers[_]
    }

    input_containers[c] {
      c := input.spec.template.spec.containers[_]
    }
```

### Ensure a specific label exists

The following schema ensures that the label `myImportantLabel` exists under `metadata.labels`:

```yaml
regoDefinition:
  code: |
    package examplePackage

    violation[labelExists] {
      provided := {label | input.metadata.labels[label]}
      required := {"myImportantLabel"}
      missing := required - provided
      labelExists := count(missing) > 0
    }
```

### Prevent use of 'latest' tag in Deployment containers

The following schema ensures that the `latest` tag is not used in any container specified in a `Deployment`:

```yaml
regoDefinition:
  code: |
    package preventlatesttag

    violation[usesLatest] {
      input.kind == "Deployment"
      imagename := input.spec.template.spec.containers[_].image
      usesLatest := endswith(imagename, "latest")
    }
```

---

## CEL

### Ensure resource name of a certain kind begins with a specific prefix

The following schema ensures all Deployments have a configured name that begins with `exmpl-`:

```yaml
if:
  properties:
    kind:
      enum:
        - Deployment
then:
  CELDefinition: 
    - expression: "object.metadata.name.startsWith("exmpl-")"
      message: "Deployments must have a name that begins with `exmpl-`" # `message` is optional
```

## Full custom rule examples

The following are examples of how the [Policy as code](/dashboard/policy-as-code) file should look before publishing it.
:::tip Reminder
To apply your new policies, [publish](/dashboard/policy-as-code#2-apply-a-new-policies-configuration) them via the CLI.  
:::

### JSON schema

This example has one custom rule written in JSON schema and added to the policy `Starter`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
policies:
  - name: Starter
    rules:
      - identifier: CUSTOM_WORKLOAD_INCORRECT_ENVIRONMENT_LABELS
        messageOnFailure: This message will override the rule's `defaultMessageOnFailure` property
customRules:
  - identifier: CUSTOM_WORKLOAD_INCORRECT_ENVIRONMENT_LABELS
    name: Ensure correct environment labels are used [CUSTOM RULE]
    defaultMessageOnFailure: Use only approved environment labels (`prod`, `staging` and `test`)
    schema:
      properties:
        metadata:
          properties:
            labels:
              properties:
                environment:
                  enum:
                    - prod
                    - staging
                    - test
              required:
                - environment
          required:
            - labels
```

### Rego

This example has two custom rules written in Rego and added to the policy `Default`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
policies:
  - name: Default
    rules:
      - identifier: CUSTOM_DEPLOYMENT_BILLING_LABEL_EXISTS
        messageOnFailure: Deployment labels should contain `billing` label
      - identifier: CUSTOM_SECRET_ENVIRONMENT_LABEL_EXISTS
        messageOnFailure: Secret labels should contain `environment` label
customRules:
  - identifier: CUSTOM_DEPLOYMENT_BILLING_LABEL_EXISTS
    name: Ensure Deployment has billing label [CUSTOM RULE]
    defaultMessageOnFailure: Deployment labels should contain `billing` label
    schema:
      regoDefinition:
        libs:
          - |
            package lib.helpers
            check_if_missing(missing) = isMissing {
              isMissing := count(missing) > 0
            }
        code: |
          package requiredlabels
          import data.lib.helpers

          violation[labelIsMissing] {
          input.kind == "Deployment"
          provided := {label | input.metadata.labels[label]}
          required := {"billing"}
          missing := required - provided
          labelIsMissing := helpers.check_if_missing(missing)
          }
  - identifier: CUSTOM_SECRET_ENVIRONMENT_LABEL_EXISTS
    name: Ensure Secret has environment label [CUSTOM RULE]
    defaultMessageOnFailure: secret labels should contain environment label
    schema:
# NOTE: you can write a constraint in JSON schema, and still write the rule logic in Rego
# In this example, the rego code will run only if the tested resource is of kind `Secret`
      if:
        properties:
          kind:
            type: string
            enum:
              - Secret
      then:
        regoDefinition:
          libs:
            - |
              package lib.helpers
              check_if_missing(missing) = isMissing {
                          isMissing := count(missing) > 0
                        }
          code: |
            package foosystemrequiredlabels
            import data.lib.helpers

            violation[labelIsMissing] {
            provided := {label | input.metadata.labels[label]}
            required := {"environment"}
            missing := required - provided
            labelIsMissing := helpers.check_if_missing(missing)
            }
```
