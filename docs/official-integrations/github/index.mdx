## Github action

To add Datree to your Github CI workflow, use our [official action](https://github.com/datreeio/action-datree).

## Github code scanning

Datree's scan results can also be presented in Github's code scanning UI under your repositories' security tab.  
This is done using output in SARIF format, see examples here: [Github code scanning](https://github.com/datreeio/action-datree#github-code-scanning-sarif)
