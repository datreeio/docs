### Overview

Datree comes with out-of-the-box support for Kustomize, allowing you to easily scan your Kustomization file and the resources it will generate for misconfigurations.

When testing a kustomization directory, Datree will build temporary copies of the resources defined in kustomization.yaml and run a policy check against them.

**Linux**, **MacOS**, and **Windows** are supported.

### Dependencies

Using the Datree CLI to scan kustomize files requires [**Kustomize**](https://kustomize.io/) and/or [**kubectl**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) to be installed.

### Usage

Simply add the 'kustomize' argument to the CLI command, like so:

> datree kustomize test \[path\] \[cliArgs\] -- \[kustomizeArgs\]

**path** - the path to your desired kustomize directory (that contains a kustomization.yaml file).  
**cliArgs** (*optional*) - your desired Datree CLI arguments, as described here: [CLI arguments](/setup/cli-arguments).  
**kustomizeArgs** (*optional*) - your desired arguments for the 'kustomize build' command. To see a list of supported arguments, run `kustomize build -h` or `kubectl kustomize -h`  

### Examples

Assuming "/path/to/dir/" is a directory containing a 'kustomization.yaml' file, the following command will perform a policy check against all generated resources:

> datree kustomize test /path/to/dir/

The following command will also perform a policy check against all generated resources, this time using k8s schema version 1.23.0 and a Datree policy named "staging":

> datree kustomize test /path/to/dir/ -s 1.23.0 -p staging

### Testing multiple kustomizations

If you have multiple kustomization directories inside a single directory, you can test all of them sequentially using the following script:

```
#!/bin/bash

path="${1:-.}"
final_exit_code=0

while read -r kustomization; do
	dir="$(dirname "$kustomization")"
    echo "Datree Kustomization Test: $kustomization"
	set +e
	datree kustomize test "$dir"
	exitcode=$?
	set -e
	if [ "$exitcode" -gt "$final_exit_code" ]; then
        final_exit_code="$exitcode"
    fi
done < <(find "$path" -type f -name 'kustomization.y*ml')

if [ "$final_exit_code" = 0 ]; then
    echo "Success"
else
    echo "Violations found, returning exit code $final_exit_code"
fi
exit "$final_exit_code"
```

The script will run a policy check against all kustomizations before exiting, and return 0 only if no violations were found in any of them.  
This is useful for CI, to avoid the need to call `datree test` multiple times.
