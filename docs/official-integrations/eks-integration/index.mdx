### Set your Datree token

When using EKS, use the following command to set your Datree token (replace `<YOUR_TOKEN>` with your token):

```terminal
kubectl get deployment datree-webhook-server -n datree -o yaml | yq '(.spec.template.spec.containers[].env[] | select(.name=="DATREE_TOKEN")) |= .value="<YOUR_TOKEN>"' | kubectl replace -f -
```
